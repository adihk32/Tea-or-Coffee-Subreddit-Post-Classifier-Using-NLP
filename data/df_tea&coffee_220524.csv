can someone please help me asses whether my teapot is genuine (and good quality)?
I bought it in a shop downtown and the price was low due to mechanical damage that happened to the lid (not seen on photos). My idea is to eventually get it kintsugi repaired, I know a guy who is schooled in that.
The teapot looks similar (not identical though) to the pots they use in a different local teahouse run by a trustworthy chinese owner. The material of my teapot also looks and feels simlar to the pots in the other teahouse, it feels good quality.
However I got little concerned when I looked at the stamp... I cant read Chinese, but the characters look odd on the stamp, it made me suspicious that the teapot might be fake.
Can anyone help? What does the stamp read?

I just bought a Gao Shan Woolong (Milk Oolong) 2 weeks ago. The seller said it is vegan, but I am not sure about this. 

He told me the tea is from Ali Shan and the plant is called QuinXin. At my insistence, he asked his importer, who told him that the tea was flavored by natural aroma. The flavoring oil used is supposed to mimic milk and osmanthus, but supposedly does not contain milk itself. I don't quite trust all that, though. Further inquiries to the seller are unfortunately futile. Searching the internet, I found both unflavored and flavored tea. The flavored tea but then steamed with milk (so no oil?). Do any of you know if the flavored oils used are vegan or if any are used at all?

A year ago i really started to get into drinking tea, mostly for health and mood reasons. Now, it's something I very much enjoy. 

Initially I had a really nice electric kettle that I loved. Then, earlier this year, it some how got a giant crack in it's glass, and not being able to spend another $98 on a new one I opted for a stove top kettle. I also enjoy this but i do miss the temperature control that the other had.

When I would make my tea, I normally just drink it hot. I would steep it in a container and then just leave it on the counter to come back to through out the day. For a long time I would use something like this.

https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0013Z9NY0/ref=cm_sw_r_apan_i_N7610QN3GMFTSG880QEJ

I can not stress enough how much I -HATE- this thing. Sure, for storing water to keep cold, it works well. My great grandma always had one in the fridge. For tea it sucks. If you're using loose leaf tea or any kinda tea bag that leaves behind particulates this thing gets all gunky and it's a pain to scrub clean. 

I got tired of it and decided to use the plastic orange juice pitcher, till i found something better, preferably made from glass. Well that time is now, because somebody melted the pitcher on the stove top. 

My kettle says it holds 3 liters, but I suspect that's if you fill it well above the fill line. That container that melted, I can't see it being anything more than 2.5 liters. I'll have to meassure how much my kettle really holds later today.  I'm looking for something that's temperature resistant glass, holds enough for my kettle, and is not a pain to clean. 

I was hoping that some kind folks here might have suggestions regarding what they like.

Long time tea fan, now getting into more interesting / premium stuff. 

1) I have some some excellent loose leaf tea I got with a gaiwan, so naturally I want to brew it gong-fu style. Problem is that some of them have a recommendation of using amounts of water that are more than the gaiwan can hold. To get the best results, should I scale down water + tea amount proportionally, or is it better to use the recommended water + tea amounts with a bigger cup and don't use the gaiwan?

2) I have some mate (not a tea, but still). I don't have a filtered straw, or the special glass for it. The packaging recommends brewing it western style, for like 5 minutes, but reading online thats not at all how its usually drank. Worth buying a kit for it or is it pretty close already? I really like it so far. 

3) What do I do if I'm drinking a loose leaf tea that can do 12 or even more infusions, but I don't have time to drink them all, or can't share it with others? Can I just put it away, and use it the next day? Feels like being wet could cause it to become worse maybe. Store in fridge/just leave it outside/let it dry, but cover it/...?

This continues from that, exploring if there is an inexpensive way to have related experience, that doesn't involve spending $80 to 100 on higher quality, natural arbor sourced sheng versions (or $50 for something presented as of more modest quality, or at least better value).  

These are ""factory teas,"" less expensive and different versions / style, with tuocha a reference to the shape, compressed into a ball, or bird's nest shape really.  They don't cost much; I just saw a newer Dayi / Taetea version listed for $6 (for 100 grams), and finding somewhat aged versions for around $10-15 isn't so unusual.  Not truly aged though, which are in higher demand.  This style of tea transitions to a warmer, milder, more complex flavor and character range after about 15 years, and bitterness and astringency switch over to other flavor and feel.  This describes what it's like trying them halfway through that transition process, at 7 and 10 years old.

Many people lost their shipments and some small tea companies lost significant money refunding their customers for these orders.  The disappearance was never explained by the shipping companies.

Because this technically violates the self-promotion rules of /r/tea we asked that Crimson Lotus post [this notification in the weekly Marketing Monday thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/tea/comments/uqtr9i/marketing_monday_may_16_2022/i94xq85/).  However, the event is set to occur on May 19th on the anniversary, so waiting for next Monday would make the notification too late.

We have compromised on posting the notification on this week’s Marketing Monday thread, but calling attention to it with this post.  This is an unusual enough offer, beneficial to many members of the /r/tea community, that we couldn’t resist working with Crimson Lotus to trumpet this event.

If you are a person who lost a tea shipment from Crimson Lotus, or ANY OTHER tea company, on May 19th, 2020, you can sign up to receive a free special sheng pu-erh cake from Crimson Lotus (plus shipping).  This is a custom blended cake labelled “519 Shanghai”.  It is also available for purchase if you did not lose a package during that unfortunate and mysterious shipping event.

I finally had the time to brew tea again and I decided to try the sample of Genmaicha I bought from Grand Tea &amp; Imports. I don't know if it's the way they display the tea in glass jars or if it's the quality of this grade of genmaicha but it tasted pretty average. I'm definitely interested in recommendations.

I found it a little nutty, as you'd expect, and surprisingly naturally sweet. I think I like it slightly more than soba because of the sweetness. My mom was much harsher but she likes her tea strong. She'll let it steep for hours.

Harney tins only have the outer lid with no inner lid. I would prefer not to buy more double sealed canisters for things that already come in cans, or put them in bags when they already come in tins and attractive ones at that. 

I am wondering if there might be a good way to seal the tins without changing them, like an aftermarket solution where I can buy maybe rubber squares of the right size or something I can cut to the right size or something like that?

I love peach iced tea, so the Invigorating Peach Fresh Brew Iced Tea bags sounded perfect. The box [contains ](https://imgur.com/gallery/h02ZoJH) 3 large pouches of tea that brew 2 quarts of iced tea each. The peach scent was noticeable before I even opened the box, and it's very strong through the sealed plastic bag. Chinese black tea mixed with Georgia peaches. The peach scent is very natural and mouthwatering. 

I always have a bit of trouble trying to figure out how much tea to use for a big pitcher of iced tea, so I hope these pouches will be perfect. It was $6US, and H&amp;S also carries larger quantities that are even less expensive. 

I love Darjeeling and Assam so Stanley's Blend of the two was too tempting. It was also on sale for $8.50US.

Harney and Sons has these little loose leaf samplers of a lot of their teas, usually $4US, so I bought a few. The Cherry Blossom green tea with cherry and vanilla was on sale for $3.20US. 

They sent me two free samples--Ceylon &amp; India Orange Pekoe tea bag and a silken pyramid bag of Chamomile. 

I'm not sure if I'm supposed to whisk the matcha as it's not a powder [tea looks like this](https://www.harney.com/products/white-peach-matcha?variant=39404095307847)

I've been buying loose leaf teas for years &amp; years so he's seen me drinking my happy green tea every day. He'd just like to see if I can help him find some types that he would like.

I am at a loss as to how to even begin to find something that has a chance of replacing the soda.

I plan on brewing in a  700mL Hario maru kyusu with a fine wire basket. My kettle is a gooseneck kettle so the water flow is restricted and not as quick as a spouted kettle. Would this impact the timing of the infusion?

When doing second, third, and fourth infusions, do you adjust the amount of water? I am seeing info about lowering the infusion time of the second pour to about half the first pour and then the third infusion is often triple the time of the second infusion.

Two things I see posted again and again are “where can I buy real Yixing?” And “Is this pot I got second hand real Yixing”. 

This post is an attempt to answer both of those as well clarify a lot of misconception about the craft in general. I spend most of my day authenticating and translating teapot seals and every summer I visit (not recently obviously) Dingshu town in Yixing China where the local artisans live and sell prefired pots. I feel I’m pretty knowledgeable. 

First some clarification. 

Yixing teapot refers extremely specifically to teapots constructed in a slab built (not thrown on a pottery wheel) method and of ore mined in and around the town of Yixing. This started with HuangLongShan mine and has expanded to others, then the government ceased mining operations at most sights. Pots are either fully hand made or half handmade. The names associated with this clay are ZiSha or ZiNi aka purple sand. There are many sub categories and specific types of clay such as DaHongNi but this is unimportant. Teapots made of other clay are not Yixing. Teapots that are injection mold slip casted are not Yixing. These pots will often have the name Yixing China stamped on the bottom though. 

This brings me to Yixing rule number one: If you bought a pot for less than 100USD. It’s not real sorry. This is the entry for half handmade pots. Fully handmade shoots that price up. Artist renown shoots it up more. You will not get Yixing for less than 100USD. Period. And those fancy sets with all the cups and poem on the box, those are the worst. 

Rule number two: if it doesn’t have a seal stamped on the bottom it’s not Yixing. The government controls pottery and works of registered artists are required to be stamped and their stamps are catalogued. If it just has a name carved into it or nothing it’s probably made in Taiwan or a fake cashgrab. 

Rule number three: if the pot is super ornate with carvings or nature scenes molded into it and you didn’t pay a hefty sum, it’s slip casted injection molded clay and fake.

So where can I get real Yixing? 

—Are you interested in function and want the best clay for enhancing tea without regard to it being “art” or one of a kind?

You want a vintage government backed factory pot. Ideally out of factory one during the 70s and 80s. Half handmade and have some liberties taken with craftsmanship but made of the best clay that is now no longer available. 

https://moodyguy.biz is the best for this. There are some others like “authenticYixing” but I personally trust this seller. 

—Do you not care so much about vintage or one of a kind and would like a modern pot centered in functionality made of authentic (but not factory one) clay?

Mud and leaves is the place to go they work with Chen Chunhong and his wife to ship in their half handmade pots. Good price, interviews with the craftsman, great craftsmanship.

— Do you want a work of art?

For modern but adhering to traditional standards and fully hand made on of a kind https://www.realzisha.com is the place. They video call with the nationally recognized and ranked craftsmen and have everything from rising apprentice works to master level potters. 

For modern and not adhering to traditional standards and form Yinchen studio is great. They offer some half and some fully handmade but they break a lot of rules in regard to teapot form and are like the modern art side of Yixing. 

Vintage fully handmade… sorry these are ridiculously expensive or on display in the national museum of Chinese art.

Now there are certainly other places to buy. I would strongly avoided these unless you are into the hobby and have done a good bit of research into authentication. The problem is that every other shop (Yunnan sourcing and the likes) don’t post the artist, clay type, or production method of their available pots. All the places mentioned above do, most having video interviews or videos of pots being made as well.

So far, though, I feel really frustrated with how weak it is coming out. I'm using about 3 times as much tea as the retailer recommends, steeping for the max recommended time, and heating water to the recommended temperature. The teas are all... nice, I guess, but they mostly taste to me like hot water with a little bit of other flavors - and very few of those flavors are what I think of as that quintessential black tea flavor.

The retailer recommends one teaspoon ""per cup"" (which I understand typically means 6 ounces in the tea world). I have a 20 ounce teapot, so I'm using 2 tablespoons, AKA 6 teaspoons. That amount expands to fill the infuser basket most or all of the way.

I've also tried adding a very small amount of sugar, but that does nothing to bring out any flavor (just makes it slightly sweet).

***Am I just not cut out for tea? Are my taste buds too weak? Any opinions or ideas are very welcome.***

These are the teas I've tried, and they were all too weak for me, though the flavors and their amount did vary between varieties:

I steeped 6 bags of tea in two cups of vodka at room temperature for 3 hours, and then added simple syrup, baking soda, and a gallon of water. I'm starting to think that steeping in alcohol was a bad idea. Perhaps it drew out a lot more caffeine than water would have.

I know I've heard before that cold brewed coffee has more caffeine than hot coffee. But I've never heard anything about tea. Does anyone know what steep time and temperature might yield less caffeine? FYI, for this project I'm not super concerned about it being bitter, I can just use more baking soda or sugar.

I've always been brewing my tea in tap water boiled (or brought up to other temp) in your standard kettle, as tap water in my country is drinkable even raw (straight from tap). The taste of tea was always.. ok-ish. Could sense different notes of flavour, no chlorine taste or smell was present, overall nice experience.

Though when I drank tea in my local teashop the difference was always there. Talking about same tea cultivars from same year tasted there and in home, as they also sell the tea leaves they serve to guests. Teashop tea was always more reach and balanced. Always. I thought that they have some great know-how, since they are business. Well... turns out it probably was just water all along.

I used bottled mineral water, all other factors seemed the same to me. Tea got far more flavour, especially in those subtle notes which suddenly exploded from the infusion taste, it was overall more reach and balanced, like in tea shop.

Now that I made a fool of myself, i read on this sub that Teavivre it's really good in terms of price/quality, and i saw that the italian ship doesn't cost 10-20$ like in other sites, so it seems a very good option to me (correct me if i'm wrong) But it's the first time i buy loose leaf tea and I don't really know what to expect from the flavour part.

In my first shipment I liked the teas, but none of them really wowed me. Peach Cobbler was too subtly flavoured/not very peachy, Cherry Bakewell was a bit tangy cherry, not much else, Dark Choc Chilli Chai was okay but didn't blow me away, Totally Nutty was quite good, but Bonfire Toffee (which I think is a great tea) just didn't somehow suit my tastebuds.

This time I got the following four teas:

* **Creme Egg Tea** - *Sri Lankan black tea, cocoa nibs, cocoa shells, jasmine blossom, sunflower petals, natural flavouring* - a really incredible tea that tastes like chocolate custard but is not remotely ""sickly"" or artificial, as many chocolate-flavoured teas can be. The jasmine is very subtle, I couldn't markedly detect it, but I feel it gives a slight floral hint/lift. As an experiment I brewed a cup adding a tiny bit of jasmine tea, and the extra jasmine actually didn't work, so I think they've got the balance perfect.

* **Birthday Cake** - *Rooibos (84%), Sri Lankan Black Tea, Sprinkles, Almond Pieces, Vanilla Pieces, Mallow Flowers, natural flavouring* - I'm not a huge fan of rooibos generally, but the almond in this really brings it together and it's an exceptionally smooth cup and much like Yorkshire Biscuit Tea, is somehow ""savoury"" rather than sweet.

* **The Big Smoke** - *Chinese pu-erh tea, ginger, lemongrass, lapsang souchong black tea, red peppercorns* - honestly one of the most fascinating and drinkable flavoured teas I've had. It's like a savoury smoky lemon chai. I will almost certainly be ordering this one again, as well as looking for similar blends.

* **Coconut Milk Oolong** - *Taiwanese milk oolong, coconut flakes, desiccated coconut* - this one is supposed to be brewed at 80c and the first time I made it I brewed it too hot, not letting the boiled water cool enough. This made it taste like bitter green tea not even an oolong. The second time I put some cold water in the cup first and the transformation was amazing. It's so smooth. I even managed to drink a cup of it without milk and didn't hugely struggle as I usually do with black/non-milk-added tea. The only thing I wonder about is whether the coconut could be a bit stronger?

The episode talked about Yogi Bhajan (Harbhajan Singh Khalsa) who came from India in the 60s and set up a big cult called [3HO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3HO?wprov=sfti1). Yogi Tea is one of the corporate entities of 3HO.

Yogi Bhajan encouraged his followers to move in together and form Ashrams. They were encouraged to buy houses and put them in the cult’s name. They were encouraged to work for the cult and to send their children to boarding schools 3HO set up in India. 

Some of the women have come out and said that they were sexually abused by Yogi Bhajan (he died in 2004, and his family now owns Yogi Tea and continues the cult). The children at the boarding schools were beaten regularly and went through a lot at the schools. While the Yogi’s family got rich, a lot of the supporters were very poor, living in squalor, and working for the cult.

I just thought Yogi tea was just one of the multiple regular tea companies on the market. I had no idea it had such a dark origin story.

I thought others would like to know and watch the episode for themselves. I have no problem with Yogis and SE Asian religions, but I do have a problem with organizations who take advantage of women and children. I thought others would like to know where their money is going. 

The people who head 3HO now deny any wrongdoing by Yogi Bhajan (even though he had multiple young wives brought up in the cult).

I'm a tea drinker and I'm planning to buy some stuff to bring tea to work. On the same occasion, I wanted to learn how to improve my preparation skills to get a better result on my beverage of choice, so in that regard I have several questions: 

\- What do I need to make good tea? I'm using tea leaves (not bags) in a cup that is made to prepare to infuse the tea, but it prevents me from making more of it or even transferring it to another recipient. So I assume that I need a kettle and something to boil the water (maybe a 2 in one?). What do you recommend in that regard? I would like something durable (lifetime would be the best) and efficient, I don't mind paying a bit extra if it's not an incoherent amount.

\- Next, the leaves. The quality is a factor but how do I recognize the good stuff from the bad one? I'm already going to a specialized shop that got a tea that smells and tastes fantastic if I compare it with basics teabags. But I don't know if it's just an ok tea or if I'm wasting my money on expensive tea that isn't worth its cost. Here's a picture of what I bought for my earl grey: [https://i.imgur.com/NWobfjh.png](https://i.imgur.com/NWobfjh.png)

\- Finally, the technique. Right now I'm not doing anything particular, I boil water, pour it into my cup (in my particular case, it's already in) then add the tea leaves and let it infuse by itself for 5 minutes. Is there anything I should do or pay attention to? 

Oh, and if you have any advice for someone that drinks mostly earl grey and earl grey variations to try something new, I'm all ears.

I've created a small ~~playlist~~  sampling list of raw pu'erh and more and ordered it from YS. Then the ""ZERO COVID"" policy came, so I had the impression that I will not see my teas again. Logically I've ordered some tea from Nannuoshan as consolation.

Today, I was presented with this:

Now... I may be a beast of tea consumer, but so far there is too much tea, too little time for tasting.

I have loved regular unsweet iced tea for years... the kind you get at McDonalds, Applebees, Olive Garden, etc. A couple years ago I bought a used restaurant grade Bunn Infusion ITB tea brewer. This model here: [https://www.etundra.com/restaurant-equipment/beverage-equipment/iced-tea-brewers/bunn-itb-dd-0003-infusion-series-dual-dilution-with-sweetener-iced-tea-brewer/](https://www.etundra.com/restaurant-equipment/beverage-equipment/iced-tea-brewers/bunn-itb-dd-0003-infusion-series-dual-dilution-with-sweetener-iced-tea-brewer/)  


I have it installed in my house with a water line plumbed to it. I have the machine set to factory settings which I'm sure is what most restaurants do, and I have tried different tea bags (Farmers Brothers, Bigelow) but the ones I have used the most that do the best are Lipton 3 gallon bags: [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MTG7Q9A?psc=1&amp;ref=ppx\_yo2ov\_dt\_b\_product\_details](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MTG7Q9A?psc=1&amp;ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details) .

should i take a dandelion plant indoors and water it and give it compost so that it has a chance to clean out whatever it might have soaked up? i know roots make good tea, in case it goes to see and i cant brew from the petals anymore.

or maybe i should pick dandelions more in the center of my lawn, farther away from my neighbors lawns?

One problem is that they tend to get crud buildup around the weld where the metal meets the mesh. 

I'd like to find something better that is easier to keep clean and possibly imparts less flavor. The problem is that the ones that are solid metal or ceramic usually have little holes instead of mesh which allows more particulates to pass which is unacceptable.

I've been considering the funnel from the Keith titanium ti3911 coffee brewer which does have holes, but they seem really really small since their is 26,000 of them and they are laser cut conically so as to be easier to clean.

However, we happen to be in the middle of a large kitchen remodel. We have space to put in an in-cabinet or countertop latte machine. 

Are there any good latte machines out there that would help in making these at home a little quicker?

Having said all that, one of the gaiwans did have wet tea in it (it’s really dry here and it was overnight, so little chance for mold), and of course clay is porous and absorbs nearly everything.

The botanical name for tea is Camellia sinensis, which comes from the family Camellia. This is the Chinese variety; in the northeast of India, a second variety known as Camellia assamica was discovered in the nineteenth century. The tea bush has leaves with finely serrated edges, with numerous oil glands. The flowers are white and have a delicate fragrance.

&amp;#x200B;

[ Tea Colours](https://preview.redd.it/zvwhoq8lnot81.jpg?width=575&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=23d10cc2169048185ae3ae7151d054fe8ebe6dbf)

The cultivation of tea requires a warm, humid climate, and cultivation at higher altitudes is considered to produce tea of superior quality, although factors such as the climate, soil, method of harvest, and processing also affect the tea quality.

The majority of teas are made from young leaves. When the bush reaches the necessary maturity, leaves are picked by hand. For the highest quality teas, only the top three newest leaves are picked.

After harvesting comes to the drying process. The leaves are spread out and left to wilt until they are very malleable and can be rolled without breaking. During this process is when the leaves release the substances that give them their characteristic color and smell.

**The giant forest**

In 1939, in the province of Yunnan in the southeast of China, a huge swath of wild tea trees were discovered. Some were more than 98 feet (30 meters) high with trunks 3 feet (a meter) in diameter. Their age is estimated to be around 1,700 years old.

**Modern and classic teas**

The custom of delicately flavored teas has been around for many years; however, fruity teas are a more recent trend and are often closer to an herbal infusion. The ideal choice is always a tea with a truly natural aroma and essence, such as those shown on these pages.

**Green tea**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ziztcyl2lot81.jpg?width=600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=928c2ab6e6628712a339d45a7e97b552e1cb17fa

[Green tea](https://lelow.online/product/darjeeling-green-tea-100-grams/) is made by drying the leaves completely to avoid fermentation. It is the most common tea consumed in China and Japan. Along with white tea, it has the most proven therapeutic properties.

Green tea tends to have a more delicate and herbal aroma. It has very little theine or caffeine; depending on the variety, the quantity may be between 8 and 16 mg per cup. By comparison, a cup of espresso can easily have more than 200 mg of caffeine. Here are some of the most highly regarded varieties:

• Bancha. Alongside Sencha, although of lesser quality, it is the most common tea in Japan. Very low in theine.

• Genmaicha. Green tea with toasted rice; is frequently drunk with meals by the Japanese.

• Gunpowder. A Chinese tea with a strong flavor, which also appeals to fans of black tea. Often in the form of leaves compressed into a small ball.

• Kokeicha. Three-year tea; is very valued in Japan. It is made by toasting very fine twigs four times. Then the twigs are pulverized and pressed into fine needles.

• Kukicha. Made up of the stems of tea leaves, it makes a yellowish infusion with a distinctive flavor and very little theine.

• Lung Ching. This tea is the lung ching (“dragonwell”). It comes from the lake region of Hangzho, China. It is celebrated for its emerald color and sweet taste.

• Matcha. Powdered green tea used in the Japanese tea ceremony; yields a rich, astringent, jade-colored infusion.

• Sencha. A Japanese classic. Also available in a decaffeinated version.

Mu Tea. The so-called mu tea does not contain tea leaves; it is actually a unique mixture of sixteen plants and spices, revived in the last few decades from an ancient oriental tradition. It has a very particular taste and is wonderful for digestion. 

**Black tea**

&amp;#x200B;

[Black Tea](https://preview.redd.it/vy454dmjlot81.jpg?width=600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b5581839253ee765fe8c6de09adc881dfc2b9a1f)

[Black tea](http://lelow.online/black-tea/) is obtained through an oxidation process. Freshly harvested leaves are left in humid rooms so they ferment. This treatment lasts between three and five hours depending on the variety, which gives the tea its characteristic dark green or black color.

Black tea has a strong flavor—closer to coffee—and can be combined with milk. It has a higher quantity of caffeine than green tea has. Each cup contains between 25 and 100 mg, depending on the degree of fermentation.

Among the most popular varieties of black tea are:

• [Assam](https://lelow.online/product/halmari-tea-assam-ctc-buy-online-best-quality/). A full-bodied tea with a warm brown color. The Camellia assamica—a different plant than Sinensis—is grown in the northeast region of India.

• Ceilan. The ancient name for Sri Lanka is given to this delicate and aromatic black tea. It is commonly sold in bags.

• Darjeeling. Called “the champagne of teas” for its delicate fragrance and flavor. It is grown on the slopes of the Indian Himalayas. It is also sold decaffeinated.

• Earl Grey. Classic British mix of black tea with bergamot. It is one of the most commonly purchased bagged teas.

**Leaves from the sky**

The Darjeeling valley is found in the northeast region of India, on the border with Nepal. Eighty-seven tea plantations in this region have a 125-year history. The plant is grown at elevations between 1,970 and 7,050 feet (600 and 2,150 meters), on steep mountainsides that drain heavy monsoon rains.

The tea that grows in this region is of unmatched quality, a bundle of it falling somewhere between sweet grapes and ripe peaches. Between April and May the First Flush is harvested, tender young teas that produce a very light infusion. The second harvest, or Second Flush, occurs in July and August, and produces a bright infusion with a more intense flavor. This is considered ideal for after-dinner drinks.

&amp;#x200B;

[leaves from Sky](https://preview.redd.it/300hjra6not81.jpg?width=576&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=39a5d91ea2dfe48df149f1e70d99a7d08fbeef67)

• English Breakfast. Invented by a merchant in the nineteenth century, this is a very strong black tea to help you wake up in the morning.

• Keemun. From Chinese, “mountain of the lion.” This is a very high-quality tea grown in the humid mountains of Anhui. Its aroma is like that of an orchid.

• Kenya. Brightly colored and intensely aromatic, this is one of the black teas with the most body. It is grown at high altitudes in the African country and is usually sold as a powder.

• Lady Grey. This is a more fruity—and feminine—version of Earl Grey. In addition to bergamot it contains rose petal and orange peel.

• Lapsang souchong. This robust Chinese tea has a characteristic smoky taste, from the process of drying leaves over a wood fire.

• Samovar. A very popular mixture developed in Russia from Chinese black tea with a touch of smokiness.

• Sumatra. This is a black tea with an intense, but slightly sweet, flavor. It is grown in the Indonesian island of the same name.

**Blue tea**

This is the name sometimes given to semi-fermented teas, also called Oolong. Instead of completing the oxidation, the fermentation is stopped mid-process—usually after about two hours. The result is a tea halfway between green and black. It has a balanced flavor with a combination of the characteristics of green and black teas, and is very popular in Taiwan. The caffeine content depends on when the fermentation is interrupted and can vary from 10 to 55 mg per cup.

**Yellow tea**

The leaves of this tea are left to mature rather than ferment. These are varieties that are difficult to find commercially. Yellow tea takes its name from the color of the infusion it produces. It has a singular and defined taste that can be slightly bitter. Its fresh scent leaves the mouth clean and dry. Its flavor—somewhere between sweet and bitter—lingers on the tip of the tongue after drinking it.

Chun Shan Yin Chin is considered the best and most valuable yellow tea. Mao-chien and Huang Da Cha are other popular varieties.

**Red tea**

There is some confusion about what is popularly known as “red tea.” The Chinese give this name to Pu-erh, a variety of green tea that only grows in the Yunnan region and is fermented to darken it. This “tea of the Emperor,” so-called because it originally was reserved only for the highest offices of power, is frequently used in diets today because of its “fat-eliminating” qualities.

Sometimes “red tea” is used to refer to Rooibos, a South African plant with a sweet taste and invigorating and healing properties, which belongs to a botanical family unrelated to tea.

**White tea**

White tea is grown in many parts of China. It is lightly fermented and gives a very lightly colored infusion. In some plants, the leaf appears to have a white fuzz. The buds are harvested just two days of the year, in spring, and are picked by hand. It takes approximately 80,000 buds to produce only 250 grams of tea; this is why the price is so high.

The legend of the white tea

Popular tradition tells that in ancient China, this type of tea was harvested exclusively by maidens with gold scissors, and only the emperor had the right to taste it. The location of the sacred gardens was itself a mystery, and those few who discovered it paid with their lives. Pai Hao Yin Chin is a fairytale about this white tea.

In Fujian, there was once a drought so severe that nothing could be harvested for many seasons. Then a plague ravaged the country and many people died. The situation got worse and worse and the elders recommended they go search for a sacred plant that grew beside the well of a dragon, in a nearby mountain. The juice of this plant, they said, would bring back the land’s prosperity and cure the sick.

Many brave young people from Fujian went to the mountains in search of this sacred plant, but none of them returned, since the well was guarded by a fierce black dragon. Two brothers and their sister decided to go on the search. The oldest was the first to go, but he did not return. The second departed and suffered the same fate. Finally, the younger sister decided to go in search of her brothers and the plant. When she got there, she found that the dragon had turned the men to stone. Using her wits, she managed to steal the plant and kill the dragon with an arrow. With a few drops of the sacred plants, she brought the men back to life and they returned to the town and planted the seeds. The land became fertile once more and the sick were healed.

From that day on, all of the plants in Fujian, a province at an altitude of 6000 meters, were of white tea, which is grown there to this day.

&amp;#x200B;

White tea has a much softer taste and scent than the other teas, and it contains the least amount of theine: about 1 mg per cup. It is highly valued for its therapeutic properties since its antioxidant power is triple that of green tea. The most well-known varieties are Shou mei, Pai hao Yin chin, and Pai mu tan.

**Aromatic teas**

Normally these are made from lower-quality leaves. In western shops, they are most often mixed based on black tea, although there are some classics made with green tea like that jasmine—highly valued in China—or Japanese lime.

Tea gourmets always prefer the pure varieties, but if they are to consume aromatic tea, they opt for flower accents.

The fragrance of the flowers is incorporated into the leaves during processing.

It is essential to achieve the right balance between tea and flowers so the fragrance does not cover the natural flavor of the tea. According to experts, the flower should make up about 30 percent of the taste and the tea should be the other 70 percent. In and of itself, the type of flower depends on the type of tea.

“An after-dinner conversation without tea disturbs the order of the universe.” - RUDYARD KIPLING

[Tea](https://lelow.online/product/giddapahar-darjeeling-first-flush-tea/) is a legendary drink that continues to gain fans around the world. In fact, its popularity has grown so much in the last two thousand years that today the only beverage consumed more is water.

**Lu Tung, “Song of Tea”**

&amp;#x200B;

[Tea Song](https://preview.redd.it/4nytw5grzmt81.jpg?width=95&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=df752baede0080552f016250535a96c9cea23cae)

1. The first cup moistens my lips and throat. 
2. The second cup breaks my loneliness. 
3. The third cup searches my barren entrail, but to find therein some thousand volumes of odd ideographs.
4. The fourth cup raises slight perspiration; all the wrongs of life pass out through my pores.
5. At the fifth cup, I am purified.
6. The sixth cup calls me to the realms of immortals.
7. The seventh cup–ah, but I could take no more!

I only feel the breath of the cool wind that raises in my sleeves.

Where is Paradise? Let me ride on this sweet breeze and waft away thither.

Someone \[Okakura Kakuzō\] said that tea “has not the arrogance of wine, the self-consciousness of coffee, nor the simpering innocence of cocoa.”

Whether used in an infusion, a smoothie, or in cooking, the delicious and delicate flavor of this plant can surprise even the most demanding gourmet.

[Leaves of Bliss](https://preview.redd.it/p7rawr2azmt81.jpg?width=187&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=91ba0d371f35cfc45b9fd6bd36183c13ff39e08a)

This treasure of health and flavor was zealously guarded by emperors for many centuries until intrepid merchants from Holland and Britain began to import it to the West.

There are many varieties of tea, defined by their origin and processing, but among all of them, green and white teas stand out for their prodigious health benefits. Their powerful antioxidant effects—and gentle stimulating properties—have been linked to the exceptional longevity of the populations in regions of China and Japan.

This book details all of these benefits and offers delicious recipes for tea lovers to enjoy new flavors in many forms: infusions, cocktails, ice creams, and sauces based on tea.

But just as the universe of Camellia sinensis—its botanical name—is immensely rich and varied, in this book we will also see other fascinating aspects of tea culture: the Japanese tea ceremony, a selection of stories for teatime, and even tea leaf readings.

**A legendary origin**

The first documents that mention [***tea***](https://lelow.online/product/darjeeling-green-tea-100-grams/) date back to the period between the seventh and sixth centuries BC. The inhabitants of ancient China in this period sang of the excellence of Tu, the name given to the group of plants which we now know as tea. This is the official origin, although if we give credit to popular legend, tea has been around since approximately the year 2700 BC. 

Between the years 206 BC and 221 AD, during the Han dynasty, improved methods of gathering and preparing tea leaves made tea a popular beverage of the royal family. Its prestige among the nobility grew, reaching its peak in the period of the Three Kingdoms (221–277 AD), when tea served as a substitute for wine at the court’s banquets.

**Emperor Chen Nung**

The French writer Maxence Fermine describes, in his novel Opium, the discovery of tea in China: “One day, more than four thousand years ago, the emperor Chen Nung was traveling with his guard through a distant region of his great country. As the journey was long and tiring, he ordered them to let him stop to rest in the shade of some trees to protect them from the sun. 

The convoy stopped and the emperor sat cross-legged under an unknown bush. Immediately, he asked for a bowl of boiling water, as he was thirsty and it was the best remedy he knew to quench his thirst. His servants hurried to bring it to him. At that moment, a leaf fell into the emperor’s bowl. Chen Nung drank the water without notice, and when he did a sweet yet bitter aroma filled his throat. Intrigued, he looked into the bowl and found the leaf that gave this fascinating scent and flavor. And thus tea was born.”

[Tea in China](https://preview.redd.it/8ey1nagmkmt81.jpg?width=302&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=68925abe3a63acaa4336772540edbfbaa807131c)

 The general population would wait another five centuries before experiencing the goodness of this virtuous plant, since it wasn’t until the Tang dynasty, from 618 to 907 AD, that tea became the national beverage of China. Proof of this is that a philosopher of the time, Lu Yu, wrote the first account of its history, cultivation, and preparation in 780 AD: the Cha-Ching.”

Tea’s reputation reached every corner of China, thanks to caravans of merchants that crisscrossed the country. In 705 AD, Camellia sinensis crossed borders for the first time and was introduced in Japan by a monk named Dengyo Daishi. During this same time period, tea arrived in Tibet and was a great success. There they boiled tablets of pressed tea and then mixed it with butter and salt. It wasn’t until the start of the twentieth century that tea in the form of infusion became popular there, although there are still many Tibetans that prefer the traditional preparation.

**Tibetan style tea**

In his memoir, Seven Years in Tibet, mountain climber Heinrich Harrer (played in the movie by Brad Pitt) describes the local custom of drinking tea mixed with yak lard, a combination that he found horrifying. The author commented that some Tibetans claimed to drink more than a hundred cups a day.

**Beyond China**

Tea had begun to cross borders at the beginning of the ninth century when the first shipments arrived by boat to Korea and Japan. There, a Buddhist monk called Yesai published the first Japanese book on tea in 1191. Both countries began to cultivate tea in the humid, mountainous regions, and their inhabitants soon learned of the therapeutic properties of the infusion. Zen monks incorporated tea in their routines in the temple, in combination with meditation that lasted all day.

Regarding the union between Buddhism and tea, the legend tells that an Indian prince named Drama had decided to devote his life to prayer. Abandoning his home, he began a pilgrimage toward China and Japan. Exhausted from the hard days of journeying, he succumbed to a deep sleep along the banks of a river and slept for a long time. 

Upon waking, he felt horrified by his laziness and meted himself a severe punishment so as not to succumb to sleep again: he cut off his eyelids and buried them in the place where he had slept. Many years later, returning to his home, he passed that same place and discovered that a strange bush was growing where he had buried the eyelids. The monk chewed a few leaves and realized that they helped keep the mind awake. Since then, the Zen monks have always cultivated tea in the monastery gardens.

**From “cha” to “tea”**

The names given for the word “tea” are very similar throughout Asia: in Japan, it’s called cha, in Russia caj, in India tschaj and in China, ch’a. Some linguists maintain that it’s possible all these names come from the word for “vitality” in Chinese, chi.

In the Fukien province of China, the Dutch learned the word tay, which means “tea” in the local dialect, and this sound was introduced to Europe. In fact, in Ireland and England, it was pronounced tay until the start of the eighteenth century, after which the word was derived to tee and then tea—as we know it today.

In many European languages, the same word is used as a generic term for herbal teas or an infusion of herbs.

Apart from making the most of tea’s curative properties, the Japanese nobles also began to include tea in their social meetings. Thus was born the Cha no yu, the tea ceremony, a delicate and demanding ritual lasting several hours, for which the hosts would have expensive and precious utensils.

**Tea arrives in the West**

The first record of the existence of tea in the West dates to the year 851 AD. It was written by an Arab merchant named Suleiman in his book Relations in China and India, where he defined it as “an aromatic herb with a bitter taste that is drunk with boiled water in the East.”

Apparently, westerners did not hear about this infusion again until 1529, when the Venetian Giambattista Ramusio wrote in his book Navigazione e Viaggi about the existence of a plant in the East that “calms pain of gout and also guarantees good stomach function.” Jesuit missionaries that visited China and Japan in the sixteenth century also spoke of a plant with a sweet taste that the natives called chai.

**The East India Company**

In the seventeenth century, the European powers competed to claim the new markets in Asia. During this process, the Dutch East India Company brought the first shipment of tea to Europe in 1606. Later, the ships of the English East India Company achieved a monopoly on tea and began to distribute it in France, Germany, and Portugal as well as England. In 1657, the first teahouse opened in London, and financial transactions involving the plant took place on its upper floors. But tea became popular in England a few years later, when King Charles II married Catalina de Berganza, a great fan of the beverage.

The Portuguese princess brought with her dowry the port of Bombay, one of the most important hubs of maritime commerce between Asia and Europe, which became key in the tea trade between the two continents. The infusion began to be served in the court and, during the following century, became the most popular beverage in England, winning over even beer and gin.

In 1834, the East India Company lost its monopoly on tea after the implementation of a British governmental resolution. With free competition between companies, the speed of the ships became more important, so large ships gave way to small, lightships called clippers. This produced true competition to be the first to arrive in port and be able to sell at the best price, resulting in all kinds of incidents and adventures on the high seas, as the typical passage took about a hundred days.

The custom of adding milk to tea—so deeply entrenched in England today—was introduced by the Dutch in the early seventeenth century and then spread to France and England. The Japanese and Chinese never add milk to tea because they believe it ruins the flavor, original color, and aroma of the infusion.

Until the beginning of the nineteenth century, tea was drunk at any time of day. The creation of the British afternoon tea—at five o’clock—is attributed to the Duchess of Bedford, who after drinking it in the afternoon with a snack found it so delicious she instituted the ritual with all her friends.

**The spread of tea**

In 1810 the Chinese began to cultivate tea on the island of Formosa, in modern-day Taiwan. A decade later in Assam, in the northeastern region of India, Robert Bruce and his brother discovered vast thickets of tea growing naturally and established the tea industry in the then-British colony, including the Darjeeling region.

In other parts of the world, tea arrived under more difficult circumstances. In Ceylan, modern-day Sri Lanka, the cultivation of tea began in earnest after a plague affecting coffee trees devastated all the plantations on the island—at that time it was the second-largest producer of coffee in the world.

In each country, tea has been introduced differently, with many local variations. The Maghrebis, for example, inherited tea from the English and their national drink is mint tea. It is served in a glass with a lot of sugar and accompanied by honey cakes. Proper etiquette dictates that the host should drink at least three glasses of tea, with the last one being stronger than the previous.

In 1900, with the inauguration of the Trans-Siberian railroad, tea was no longer transported by camel from Peking to Russia. And four years later, Richard Blechyden presented a refreshing invention at the St. Louis World’s Fair: iced

I'm thinking fruitiy but I really don't know what I would like. Something with lower caffeine would be alright but I don't think it will be a problem as I don't plan to drink teal like I did coffee and having multiple cups a day.

So today I went to Walmart and picked up some loose leaf infusers but found no good loose leaf tea. Now I would like to purchase some online that will meet a few requirements preferably. 

1. Little to no caffiene 
2. Loose leaf
3. Not expensive (25 dollars for a few ounces)

I'm not in the best spot financially but love tea and want to expand my knowledge of tea. So far I've mostly just ever had herbal from brands like celestial, stash, and Bigelow. I have found that some of these herbal teas are far too weak in flavor for me and end up just being slightly altered water. However some flavors such as Bengal Spice, or peppermint, have been absolutely wonderful when mixed into a sort of latte with milk and honey. I also really loved the decaf chai black tea from Bigelow. I am putting in an order for some earl grey and some English breakfast decaf from TheTeaKitchen and GoodlifeTea. Anything negative to say about these brands? Any brands I probably shouldn't buy from and brands I most definitely should buy from?
Thank you and I'm sorry if this came off as obnoxious or rude in any way, just not doing too hot on money and also my anxiety gets worse with caffiene.

I'm a tea newb in the sense I don't know much outside loose leaf black teas (started with chai, but I diversified to some other stuff). Outside that I don't know anything about anything. I tried a somewhat expensive bagged green tea from hmart for the first time and got a headache drinking it because it was so bad. I've had really good green tea at a japanese tea garden which I loved tho so I know its just some low quality side effect or smt.

Coming to my main questions (no need to answer all, just be like { 2) &lt;followed by your answer&gt; } ), I would like tea recs and ingredient suggestions for the following:

1) a green tea, ive had hojicha, matcha, genmaicha which i liked (have heard of longqing, gyokuro, never had though) 

2) what tea has the highest and/or most diverse antioxidants?

3) is Pu er really that good and what is butterfly pea tea, are these worth getting, are they super healthy or what?

4) if I want to just diy something and combine green tea, herbal tea, and something with a hint of spice into a coffee filter tea bag, what ingredients could I combine to create such a tea profile?

&amp;#x200B;

I know these are a lot of questions. I'm trying to do my own research but there is a lot of 'fake' info online and I would like to hope that the people here have more insight than other internet goons. I am also reading the subreddit here for info so if you have links to check or key words to tell me instead of explaining yourself, that's also appreciated!

My face acne is getting worse and that aside, it’s rotting my teeth. I have REALLY good teeth, but if I keep drinking soda, I could gain major cavities. And my soda intake is BAD, I drink multiple sodas a day, and my room is literally filled to the brim with empty cans. However, that was days ago, now I’m drinking water and haven’t touched soda in, like, 2 days. Now, I probably won’t quit soda forever, but I want to definitely lower my intake and daily consumption, cutting it down to maybe one soda a week. And I feel tea could probably fill that role. 

Just like most users who are asking about tea for the first time, I’m SUPER inexperienced. I’ve never brewed or brought tea that wasn’t either Snapple or Gold Peak. I don’t even drink tea period, wasn’t my forte. However, i think I want to make the switch if it’ll be better than soda, since I know I can’t keep drinking water forever, I’ll eventually go cold Turkey sooner or later, and the cravings are sort of coming back. 

The question is… where do I start? I’m a student in HS, so having a cup every day would be nice. I don’t know if I’ll buy tea online unless I get really invested. There is a Trader Joe’s near me and I read somewhere on the subreddit that TJ has good tea selections.

I've jumped on the matcha train! After doing my research, I've decided to ditch coffee so I can reap all of the benefits of matcha; I am very excited!

I just received my first packed of Encha Ceremonial Grade and do, however, have a few questions.

I am used to making an cold latte in the morning in a 18oz cup. This used 2 shots of espresso, followed by filling the rest of the cup up with milk. I'd say 16oz milk.

I am wanting to replace the espresso with matcha powder, therefore, I am wondering the proportions.

I read on the Encha site to mix 1 tsp of matcha powder with 2oz of water, followed by 5-6oz of milk.

Because I still want to consume generally the same amount of milk in the morning, I am wondering if I should do 2 tsp of matcha powder with 2oz of water, followed by 16oz of milk? Or should I do 2 tsp of matcha powder with 4oz of water, followed by 14oz of milk?

Side question, I am also wondering why Encha suggests to mix the matcha powder with water first, prior to filling the cup up and mixing with milk?

TL;DR: whats a good way to keep/obtain boiling water for fresh brewed tea during a hike?

This spring I'd like to have some nature outings and take time while I'm out to have a mini tea-picnic in serene settings. There are some wonderful travel gongfu sets out there these days, but I'm wondering if there's anything out there that can really keep a container of near-boiling water for a few hours.

Lets say I boil water at home, put it in a pre-warmed vessel, travel 0.5-1.5 hours, hike for an hour, and then want to make a pu-erh to share with my friend(s) (so at least 500-700ml). 

In a typical thermos I'm skeptical that the water will remain close enough to boiling to be useful, though perhaps for a green or oolong, maybe black if the trip is on the shorter side. A video demonstration from Zojirushi shows about 40 degrees drop from boiling in 6 hours, so if we can assume linear drop, that means -20 degrees after 3hr, bringing it to about green/oolong territory

There exist car-lighter powered boilers, but I often won't be traveling in a car. [Another redditor explained why it's unlikely a USB powered kettle would exist](https://www.reddit.com/r/tea/comments/kp4v64/any_good_portable_electric_kettles_i_could_buy_to/ghv4gyo/) but this also assumes you're boiling water from scratch, I think it wouldn't be so bad if you were using fairly hot water like in the above scenario and using a heating element to slow the temperature drop...

Which brought me to the existence of temperature controlled travel mugs, but from what I can see these are also almost all car-powered, though a few battery powered ones are out there but they mostly top out around 140F.

Lastly there's the camping approach, but almost any fuel stove and pot to boil water will be bigger than the entire travel gongfu set, so unless I was actually camping I think this would be untenable for an enjoyable hike.

Anyone have any other ideas? Have I unfairly discounted one of the above approaches? Or does anyone have experience trying this? Maybe the tried and true thermos is ""good enough""...

i have been a long time tea drinker, different flavours, with sugar, honey or pure (tried with milk once but i guess i didn't have the correct kind of tea ?)  but i have never gotten into the ""sit down and enjoy"" part... i am more of a practical person and i prefere making a litre than a cup...

since having dipped into trying different kinds and also some more ""expensive"" mixes (still from the supermarket though) i would say that i taste the difference, but i never really had a ""wow moment""

having dabbled in different forms of trinking tea, i always thought there has to be ""more""...
people wouldn't make such a big fuss about it  if there wasn't...

so i guess the tl;dr is if there is ways to enjoy tea instead of drinking, or if it comes down to quality of blend or any other factor

-	Dishwasher safe
-	Can hold up to 2 cups of tea
-	Strainer doesn’t let out little leafy bits
-	Budget $30-$40

I drink loose leaf tea almost exclusively, but bagged tea is very convenient for travel. Living in Switzerland I have found a few good brands (Sirocco, Länggasstee) that offer tea pyramids with good loose leaf tea in them, but I end up paying something like 0,60-0,80CHF (US$ 0.70-0.90) per bag that way.

In the US in the past I had bought Numi teabags in bulk pack (100 ct) which is currently about $0.35/bag. I never thought Mighty Leaf justified its price premium over Numi, FWIW.

Filling my own tea pouches would somewhat cancel the convenience of bagged tea for travel, so I am definitely looking for prepackaged bagged / pyramided teas.

Any recommendations for bagged high quality black teas (nothing exotic, it could be an ""English Breakfast"" or a ""Yunnan Golden Special"" or something like just a decent Assam, Qimen, Darjeeling, etc)? I am currently looking at Tealyra. I've ordered loose leaf tea from them in the past with mostly  positive results. I realize they aren't viewed as a really excellent / expert provider, but I'm not looking for niche teas, just pretty darned good bagged tea - ie, better quality than Numi but less than the $.60/bag I am paying in Switzerland :) I've never ordered from Adagio but they're pretty pricey for bagged tea...

Wondering if people could recommend some to try, particularly black teas, as I feel that's the one tea I am underrating the most. 

Teas tried before:

Black: Smoked Lapsang Souchong (absolutely loved it), Keemun (not really a fan, have tried medium and high quality, it's doable with milk).
Oolongs (likely my favourite type): Da Hong Pao (loved &amp; have a ton), Rou Gui (loved), Dongfang Meiren, Tie Guan Yin, and Pheonix Oolong (all three liked quite a bit). 
White: Silver Needle (decent, oddly preferred lower quality than high due to astringency). 
Green: Dragon Well (decent, good at room temp with rock sugar), Organic Green (meh).

I’m relatively new to wine but I’ve been drinking it in - literally and intellectually - a lot in the past few months, and I’ve noticed that the aroma of different wines left at the bottom of the empty glass are not unpleasant, and are very different from each other and the wines that used fill the glasses. I can pick out distinct notes, and to my nose, they can broaden the wine’s flavor profile. They can even sometimes show if a winemaker was cutting corners by adding artificial flavors to a cheaper wine.

Why I even considered taking this practice semi-seriously: I also like drinking tea in the traditional Chinese style known as gongfu. A big part of enjoying your tea this way is smelling your empty cup (or gaiwan) after you have finished it. All of the antioxidants, oils, and flavor compounds are the most concentrated and fragrant when your cup is empty, and it produces a warmer, richer nose than any other way to smell tea, be it the wet leaves or the the drink itself. The name for this is bēi xiāng, and it is a fundamental part of tea tasting.

I haven’t found that wine drinkers often include this in the process of their own tasting and aside from cultural differences and practices from the east to the west, I suspect it’s because wine and tea are very different kinds of beverages, and wine oxidizes very quickly when there is a high surface area to volume ratio. That being said, the multitudes of flavor compounds are still there, only a minority of them oxidize straightaway, and the alcohol does the same evaporative legwork that a heated gaiwan does in concentrating the aroma. More importantly, in this novice’s opinion (who hardly has a grasp on any of the science behind this) the empty glass smells quite good, better than the actual wine smells in a few cases.

 I currently own two products from Teavana, 1 is the stainless steel tea basket (which has worked well but It's still hard to clean out my Thai tea, even if I clean it out right away).  Then I have their pot thing which lest you push the liquid into a mug from the bottom, but I hate this thing as it stained on it's first use and is also not the easiest to clean as particles still get stuck in the mesh...plus...IT STAINED. I  also had a ball with a chain that my mother brought home one day that was great and actually stayed clean but it broke one day. I've been drinking tea my whole life, I usually drink Green (sencha or Matcha) tea in the mornings and I'm just looking for something that won't stain and won't break.

I'm a pretty passionate coffee guy, and have recently developed an interest in tea. I have been watching some resources on YouTube, Mei Leaf for the most part, and I have some ideas i would like to discuss with some people that know much more about tea than i do.   


So, after i had gotten my quality tea, i still wasnt happy about how the tea tasted. It was full of bitterness and left my tongue very dry, I'm assuming those are the tannins working their magic. I therefore troubleshooted my process and turned out im brewing with too much leaf for too long, and in one of those tea balls. I then watched Mei Leafs video where he showed off the \[Conniseur Tea Brewer\]([https://youtu.be/puldqGnW9P0?t=1521](https://youtu.be/puldqGnW9P0?t=1521)), and i thought ""My, oh my, that works a lot like some coffee brewers that are very popular, the \[Hario Switch\]([https://youtu.be/2sYSCqCkF6k?t=106](https://youtu.be/2sYSCqCkF6k?t=106)) (timelapse where you can see easily how it works), or the Clever Dripper. They are basically holders for a coffee filter with a valve at the bottom. You rinse your filter, put in your coffee and water and let it infuse french press style, and then you open the valve after the desired brew time to release the coffee through the paper filter and into the cup. I then thought to myself ""How is this different to what that tea brewer is doing?"", and that is where you guys come in.   


Would the Hario Switch be a viable tea brewer?   
Is filtering tea through a (pre rinsed) coffee filter a bad thing?   
Do you see any other problems using these brewers?   
Do you see any overlap between tea and coffee?

Drank 5 cups a day, every time I went to the supermarket would walk through the tea aisle literally just to inhale the scent; would even frequently eat the leaves, wet or dry.

Anyway, all that to say tea was a huge part of my life, and I couldn't really imagine going without it. Then January this year, contacted covid. Was very mild fortunately. During that time was only drinking water/hydralyte. Never lost my sense of smell or taste at any point (which is what I was initially worried about)-- but ever since, the one lingering effect is that I have completely lost my appetite for tea. Would even go so far as to say the thought of tea almost repels me. This goes for every type of tea. And it's not like they smell any different than before, it's just I feel my brain flicked a switch and decided not to enjoy it any more. I think I've only drunk 2 cups since January and I didn't enjoy them much at all. They were some of my favorites too (milk oolong, sencha).

The bubbles, though, ruined it. There was nothing bubbly about it, like the enjoyable fruity pop from the cold ones. It was a soft, sticky substance that I ended up swallowing whole, dreading each one. I attempted chewing it and it's just gross.

I tend to brew western-style, though at some point I would be interested in getting a cheap gaiwan and taking it for a spin.

I’ll probably initially buy greens at my local Asian grocery, but was curious as to other possible sources (there’s not a local tea shop for hours, alas). 

What I like: Gunpowder green, Darjeeling, oolong, your basic black blends, jasmine green, lapsang souchong—stronger flavors in general. Would love to eventually experiment with more subtle flavors, but I realize that a budget buy might not have that sort of thing.

I find that the standard method of brewing iced tea in one huge batch and steeping it for 5 minutes or more does a disservice to the flavor of the tea, usually in the form of an overly tannic/bitter finish.  Sometimes traditionally-brewed iced tea is drinkable, but for me, iced tea made the typical way is never *great*. 

The method I'm sharing here makes a far better iced tea, and borrows its main principles from gong fu style brewing ( it uses more leaf, less water, shorter steeps). It requires more hands-on time, and it does use ***a lot more tea*** than the standard iced tea method,  but the overall amount of time it takes me to make iced tea this way is actually a bit less than the ""standard"" way and the flavor is going to be incredible. If you're someone who likes to make iced tea out of high-quality leaves, I think you'll appreciate that you're getting a more true-to-flavor beverage this way. 

This approach produces full-flavored iced tea with excellent dimension, color, and body with no bitterness. It works equally well for black, oolong, green, and white teas, and it also produces great results with flavored and scented teas.   


**Supplies:**

*To brew tea this way, you'll need:*  


1. Loose leaf tea — whatever kind of tea you like will work, just not teabags. 
2. A glass pitcher for iced tea. I use an 800mL (\~28 oz.) glass pitcher. I recommend shooting for 750mL-800mL for this method, particularly if you are using flavored or scented teas. You want to be able to fill this container with 2-3 steeps; after that, flavored tea can get a weird and bland IME. If you're brewing with pure teas, you could go bigger if  you wanted since those tend to hold up through more steeps. 
3. A 350mL-500mL teapot with strainer. You can go bigger if you want, but I very strongly recommend steeping no more than 400mL of tea at once and doing multiple steeps. Doing it this way will get you more dimension in the flavor of your finished product. I also recommend a strainer that is large enough to allow enough room for your tea leaves to open up fully.  
4. A kitchen scale 
5. An electric kettle with variable temperature settings (optional, but it does make this a lot easier)

*I have recs for the tea pitcher and the teapot w/ strainer if you need them, but I don't want to post those here so people don't mistake me for a teaware shill. And if you already own stuff that's pretty close to what I'm describing, it will work great! But if you want to know what I'm using, send me a message and I'll happily tell you.*  


**Instructions:**

1. Using the tea amounts specified below, add the leaf to your pot.
2. Heat your water to the temps specified below. Add the heated water to your pot 350mL to 400mL at a time.
3. Steep according to the time chart below based on your tea. You will need to do 2-3 steeps to fill an 800mL
4. **I do not add ice to the pitcher!** I only add ice to my glass when I'm ready to pour a glass of tea. And I always chill the tea in the fridge first. I like to make the tea the night before I plan on drinking it and chilling the tea in the fridge overnight. 

**TEA AMOUNT (per 100mL of water)**

* *I'm usually brewing around 350mL of tea at a time, so for example, if I were making green tea, I use 14g of tea leaf, which is 3.5 x 4g. If I were brewing 400mL at a time, then I would use 16g of tea.*
* *These numbers are approximate, it's okay to go a little more or less, depending on your tastes.*

**STEEP TIMES (in SECONDS, not minutes!)**

* *I don't rinse my leaves before making iced tea, so I'm not including any rinse times here*
* *If you're using pearl style tea you might need to add a little time to the first steep to give the balls time to unfurl, but I admittedly haven't iced any pearl teas yet so I don't have any specific recommendations on timing for those*
* *These are the times that work best for me, but you can adjust according to your preference. But we're working with seconds, not minutes — and I promise you're going to get a full flavored tea because you're using such high ratio of leaf to water.*

Apparently, you can get away with brewing ripe pu'erh at a much higher temperature, though. (Similar to a black tea.)

Siberian Delight

Northern Estate Assam
Ingredients: Single Estate Assam Black Tea 

Yunnan Black Needle
Korakundah FOP Black Tea

Snow Buds (a white tea)

as a beginner to finer teas, I tried the Intro to Tea Set from What-Cha https://what-cha.com/products/intro-to-tea-collection. I finished most of it and contemplate my next order, I was hoping for some recommendation based on my experience with the Set.

My favorites were the Georgian Natela's Gold Standard Black tea and the Taiwan Red Oolong. I will certainly be ordering more of these two. The Honey Black Tea was also nice and while I still enjoyed the Assam, it was my least favorite of the three black teas. As far as the Oolongs are concerned, I enjoyed the more oxidized ones more than the lightly oxidized Taiwan Four Seasons, which I wouldn't have been able to distinguish from a Green Tea. I didn't like the two Green Teas very much. Finally I had a free sample of a charcoal roasted Four Seasons Oolong which I thought was nicer and more full-bodied than the regular Four Seasons Oolong.

On a whim, I decided to add a splash of soy milk and a spoonful of sugar. As soon as I took a sip, I spat it out. It tasted SO salty. This was my first time trying a non-dairy milk in tea, so I thought that might be why it tasted so funky. I added another spoonful of sugar, gave it a taste, and it was even saltier than before. I mean salty like sea water. Absolutely undrinkable.

Today, I experimented a little. Here are my findings:

Tea on its own: tasted fine.
Soy milk on its own: tasted fine.
Sugar on its own: tasted fine.
Tea + soy milk: tasted fine.
Soy milk + sugar: tasted fine.
Tea + sugar: tasted salty.
Tea + soy milk + sugar: tasted salty.

I also tried the above experiments with a loose leaf Earl Grey, an Earl Grey tea bag, and a loose leaf Kenyan. None of them tasted salty.

So, it’s got to be the combination of the Assam tea and the sugar where things get interesting.

I know the temperature will gradually decrease but should it be that low from the start? Is that factored in?

I'm quite a fan of black teas, and drink a lot of whole leaf teas from Yunnan particularly (mostly from Yunnan Sourcing, absolutely love what I get from them). I also regularly try new teas.

About a year ago I bought some ""Hongyu Hong Cha Ruby Nr. 18"" from a local tea shop in Switzerland (they don't have it in stock at the moment so I can't link to their web page for it). I thought it was absolutely delicious, one of my all time favorite teas - malty, rich, incredibly aromatic, with some lovely plum / plum brandy / sweet chocolate notes that were just awesome.

I'm in the US visiting family now, and ordered what I was hoping was going to be the same tea from Tealyra - [https://www.tealyra.com/loose-tea/oolong-tea/brandy-oolong-ruby-18/](https://www.tealyra.com/loose-tea/oolong-tea/brandy-oolong-ruby-18/)

The prices were similar, and it seems an obscure and fairly particularly named tea, so I thought there were good odds that it would be from the same producer or at least quite similar. The leaves look quite identical to my eye. However the tea I got from Tealyra, while perfectly decent and tasty, is nowhere near as aromatic or complex as the tea I bought in Switzerland. In both cases I'm using well filtered water, and all the other teas I typically drink are pretty equally delicious in both locations. I've played with water temp between 90-100C for the new tea, but it just seems definitely dulled, lacking the rich sweet brandy/plum/chocolate notes, and it seems less rich as well. I will take some back home with me to brew in Switzerland to see if there is something about the water. I would love for that to be the difference, but I guess it won't be.

Could the tea from Tealyra be old? Are there multiple producers of this tea? Any way of telling what the quality is going to be like buying a tea with a name like this in the future? Other suggestions / thoughts about the pretty large difference in apparent quality? In both cases the tea costs around 20 $/chf/eu for 50 grams, so it's not cheap.

Firstly, I want to make an order from Fortnum but as I'm in the U.S., shipping is steep so I'm looking to add some things to my order to get a bit more bang for my buck. I have tried their Countess Grey and love it (managed to get it on Amazon), but I've decided I ""need"" the Spode Italian Green teacup and I can only get it from there AFAIK. So what else to throw into my order? I love Earl Grey and variations on it, English and especially Irish breakfast teas, white tea, jasmine, and lavender. I'm also open to trying new things if they have any other great stand-outs.

I'm also in the market for teas and tisanes without caffeine for after-dinner. If Fortnum's has some to recommend that would be awesome, but I'm also very open to get them elsewhere too. I've been enjoying Twining's Lemon Ginger (but didn't care for Harney's), and Harney &amp; Sons' Yellow &amp; Blue and would like a few more for my rotation. I LIVED for Teavana's Citrus Lavender and trying to find a replacement for it is actually what led me to /r/tea and started me on a tea ""journey."" Open here to decaf versions of true teas as well... I'd never turn down a rec for a really good decaf Earl Grey or Irish breakfast.

I'm sure you can imagine how reading the vague descriptors of ""floral,"" ""fruity,"" ""nutty,"" ""umami,"" and ""vegetal"" over and over started to make those words lose all meaning. Still, I think I've assembled a list of teas I might enjoy trying so I'm back here to consult the good people of reddit. 

I tend to favor herbal teas because I like those floral notes. Chrysanthemum, rose, jasmine, bergamot, lavender. I also enjoy the nuttiness and gentle almond flavor you can get from white teas though lately they all taste flavorless to me. I don't have anything against black tea or oolong. I just have less experience with the good ones. I tend to drink black tea or earl grey for a little caffeine and with lots of milk and sugar. With oolong, I just drink whatever someone hands me. As for what I dislike, I don't do well with strong blends, but I think that has less to do with the strength of the tea and more to do with the blend. Dried fruit is especially headache-inducing for me.

I like having teas with baked goods and desserts so it would be great to find something complementary. If I could find a tea to cut through enough that I could brew it all day and have it with meals, that would be even better. Anyway, here is my current list that I'm looking to narrow down...

I want something cheap. Think Red Rose or store brand. 

We don't have much preference for bags vs loose leaf, but it's hard to find stuff that is in compostable bags that isn't also wrapped in something non-compostable (looking at you Bigelow). I don't mind loose leaf, but have yet to find something real cheap for a multi cup a day drinker. I like Republic of Tea's offerings but they're pretty pricey for me (like 4x Red Rose).

I'm looking specifically for a morning black tea and simple green tea. English breakfast style is my fave, but any simple black tea along those lines should be fine. I'm picky about my green tea, but might just be because I got hooked on it when Starbucks had Tazo. Bigelow's basic green tea is good for me and Tazo Zen is still probably my favorite. Keep the lemongrass, citrus, and sweeteners out of it. And some just taste like grass. I know it's tea and plants to begin with but ya know...sometimes it taste like grass and not tea. I don't know what to call that type of green tea in the sort of ""official"" tea name.

No Lipton. Stuff tastes like plastic to me for some reason. 

I don't mind ordering online, but if that's the route I'd prefer something I could buy by the case or maybe pound/kilo. Don't want to be ordering every other week.

Oh, and if it's supposed to be compostable I'd prefer something that is official. There's a lot of sites out there claiming this or that is compostable, but it's hard to track down any hard information. I keep mentioning Bigelow because they straight up shout it out on their website. Maybe it's greenwashing but it's better than some rando blog that says they emailed customer service.

They're Palestinian and she says they call it ""Zeitmani"" (sp?) however they don't know the English name, or if there is one. Apparently it grows in the hills between rocks. It tastes like it's maybe closest to Oregano, but...not quite? 

I tried Googling around for that name, but only found one link that didn't work. Is there an English name for this? I want to buy more but can't find it. I went to my local Middle Eastern store and they didn't know what it was either.

Anyway, I've attached a pic. If anyone knows what this is I'd sure love to find a source for it. Thanks!

Dragonwell is certainly one of my favorite teas, as well as one of the most coveted. Part of me just wants to experience the pinnacle of one of my favorite teas, even if the experience does not scale with the cost.

三年药 3 years, medicine;

七年宝 7 years, treasure.

I've seen posts saying majority of oolongs are flavored or sprayed to get that buttery aroma. The vendor mentions nothing about flavoring or additives.

I have contacted the vendor but I doubt they will be honest this entire ordeal has made me angry. I am also concerned the vendor genuinely will not know whether its flavored or authentic. The vendor may be lied to as well. This seems so shady selling a product as a natural premium tea when in reality it is covered in ""butter chemicals"" what a joke. 

Is it more than likely flavored? I've heard they steam it in milk but on the next post people debunking that as false. Does no one know what they are doing to these teas? So absurd...

3: if the flavor is bad but you want the health benefits (like spearmint for pcos, or peppermint for ibs, and yes I know many of this community thinks tisanes are scams, but theres some research to back these up): add a lot of milk lol. Fortified oat milk in particular makes spearmint taste so soothing and delicious, and I get calcium and vitamin d while im at it

God, I loved that thing. I took it everywhere with my Cuisinart temperature preset kettle and made tea for so many friends. One day, I opened my carrying backpack and found it had cracked into three pieces. I bought a replacement after that happened roughly 3 years ago — as close to the same pot as I could find, which is where that link above actually comes from.

I enjoyed that pot for some time before the stupidest piece broke — the plastic weld broke where the plunger disc meets the shaft separated, leaving the disk separate from the plunger rod. I even contacted Bodum about this, because I saw plenty of replacement strainers and french press pieces on their site, but not this plunger. Something so cheap and simple to replace, and they effectively said ""we only sell those with new pots. Please understand.""

**Summary: I'm looking for a new teapot. Infuser pot, please, nothing stove-based. I would like to avoid Bodum after they couldn't source an inexpensive, simple piece for my (now-broken) teapot (but if you know of a Bodum product that's so good you have to recommend it, I'm open.) Otherwise, I'm open to any infuser teapot — ideally about 50 ounces, but of course every manufacturer is different and variation doesn't hurt.**

I'm looking for an electric kettle to use for tea and coffee, and I seem to be having trouble finding one that matches what I'm looking for. Do you have (or know of) a kettle like this?

* **Notification:** Loud notification when water reaches temperature (I'm often in my office working while waiting for water to boil, and a tiny beep or no sound at all will mean I forget that I was even making a cup of tea). A slight bonus if the volume can be controlled (muted if someone is sleeping, etc.) but not required
* **Interface:** A good user interface; I hate electronics where everything is one button and it's annoying or unintuitive to change settings
* **Temp:** Should have a range of temperatures; 170-212 should be fine, and 5° increments or preset buttons would probably be fine. Should be relatively accurate/consistent
* **Material:** Interior should be completely metal or glass (no plastic inside of kettle)
* **Size:** 1-1.75 liters
* **Safety:** Auto shutoff/boil-dry protection so I don't burn down the house if I do miss what is hopefully a loud notification
* **Speed:** Boil 4 cups of water in 4-6 minutes 
* **Location:** US

&amp;#x200B;

Other considerations:

* **Spout**: Gooseneck not needed (and probably want to avoid) since we are mostly using a large 32-ounce french press or pouring water to steep tea (no pour-over or gaiwan). Our current stovetop kettle has a terrible spout and belches water all over the counter when pouring so anything will be an improvement over that.
* **Quality/Warranty:** Want something with a good warranty and/or that should last for 5+ years
* **Keep Warm:** As long as the notification is loud enough, I don't necessarily need a keep warm function; my tea/coffee brewing is spread throughout the day
* **Other**: Will appreciate if it's easy to clean occasionally (water is relatively hard here)
* **Budget:** Fine with spending up to $200 if it's worth it

I've ruled out:

1. the Fellow Corvo &amp; Stagg (no beep)
2. the Bonavita (seems to have rust &amp; longevity issues)

I am trying to surprise my fiance with some new Teas! 

We are in the Toronto Area, but I have no problem ordering online in Canada as well.  

Her favorite tea is the Directors Blend Tea from East India Tea Company which is very hard to get here/import as I have done this in the past.  

She is into the Earl Greys, English Breakfast, stuff like that.  

She also enjoyed the Camellia Sinensis but want to see if there’s anything else in the Toronto Area.  

If anyone can let me know  their favorite teas in the area, or from an online Canadian distributor, that would be much appreciated!


Cheers,

From an espresso person that has absolutely no idea and needs help!

My usual technique with making any tea is to heat up the water to the correct temperature / boiling, add in the tea leaves, let it Brew for the desired time, and then add milk / sweetener. To make it thicker should I brew the tea leaves while the water is heating up? Should I do half milk half water?

I have a few questions that I cant find answers to about getting tea drunk.

I am learning to brew Gong Fu style and found out about this recently.

how can you tell if you are tea drunk?

is it addictive similar to alcohol or drugs?

how much tea should I be drinking alone daily without getting tea drunk. just to enjoy tea.

I put in an order from What-Cha in January, which had both a Georgian and an Iranian orthodox tea, both of which were fantastic. The Iranian tea in particular was unusual, reminding me of a cross between musty books and potato chips. This resulted in me ordering a bunch of teas from Georgia which cab I think one of the widest range of flavors I have found for tea from such a small area.

I'm now trying to find any orthodox black or all oolong tea that I can find from the general area around the Black and Caspian Seas. In particular:

1. I would like to find, if possible, some orthodox Turkish teas. I found a site in Singapore called TWG which apparently is well known in some circles and has a lot of teas from unusual places, but with frustratingly vague descriptions on tasting notes and where specifically they are grown. They have a Rize BOP which is out of stock, but in my experience broken grades tend to brew up like CTC teas and I try to avoid them these days.  They also have a tea called Grand Istanbul, but without much information on the tea itself. And that's the only place I've found selling what looks to be Turkish orthodox tea.

2. I would like to find more Iranian teas if they do make other black or a long orthodox teas, however it appears that Lahijan maybe the only place in Iran exporting orthodox tea in which case I would still like to get more. So far I've only been able to find it from What-Cha (I will do another order when they get new stock in, but there aren't enough things they have in stock now I haven't tried to justify another international order), from a few other non-US sites which mostly sell things other than tea, and from TWG, which I will probably order from eventually.

3. I know that Azerbaijan grows tea along the black sea. But the only Azerbaijani tea I can find our second hand resellings of what is clearly CTC tea, it seems to be a similar company to Çaykur. So it would be really neat to find some orthodox Azerbaijan teas.

4. It would not surprise me if you could get some good teas from nearby areas as well, since tea grows well in a wide variety of climates and the geography of the area is such that you get a huge variety of micro climates. However I cannot identify any other areas in neighboring countries that I am aware of that grow and export tea (tried googling neighboring countries that seemed plausible and they only turned up herbal ""teas""). Still if anyone knows of interesting orthodox tea grown in the West Asia/Southeastern Europe region I'd be interested in that as well.",False,False,False,tea,t5_2qq5e,604088,public,self,Other (besides Georgia) orthodox black/oolong teas from the Black/Caspian Seas?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/tea/comments/t2dgf9/other_besides_georgia_orthodox_blackoolong_teas/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,d77c3cbe-9254-11e1-9341-12313d051e91,dark,,,,,,,,

I am a heavy drinker of tea, drinking Sencha, Bancha, Genmaicha, Gyokuro and Jasmin tea using Mao Fen green tea.

I am using an electric kettle to put water at the recommended temperature and then use a mug with a filter. I generally use \~6g for 300ml. I wait the recommended time using a timer and drink.

I wanted to look for me chinese green tea, this is why I joined this sub-reddit. But after going through the post, I saw most of you using teapot and small teacup of at most 100/150ml.

Are you drinking only 100ml of tea ? Or do you use the teapot to fill up the small teacup again ? Isn't it going to get tea colder ? Or biter if you let the tealeaf in the teapot ? Or maybe you are using a second vessel after the teapot to fill up multiple time the teacup ? Is there an advantage to use small teacup ? Maybe for expensive tea ? Is there even an advantage to use a teapot over a mug with filter ? To enjoy my high quality tea to it's fullest should I brew it using a teapot and drink in a small teacup ? Why ?

She puts on a white gown and fixes her hair. Then she welcomes two friends to the party, one is wearing a black dress with a black fascinator. They go to the garden where they begin to have tea. They have fancy afternoon tea cookies and the video ends with them exchanging gifts. One woman receives a ring while another gets something that looks a bit like a hat.

The thing is also that I’ve got really insensitive tastebuds and would like recommendations of flavoured teas with an especially intense flavour (could be for example caramell or vanilla but also fruits or berries). I’d also like suggestions of Mariage Frères teas (I have e-mailed them in search of more recommendations).

My favourites are the following teas, that I can discern the flavour of.

Flavoured teas:
1. Hot Cinnamon Spice (black tea from Harney &amp; Sons)
2. Marco Polo (black tea from Mariage Frères)
3. Wedding Impérial (black tea from Mariage Frères)
4. 1837 Black Tea (black tea from TWG)
5. Rooibos Wimbledon (herbal tea from local teashop)
6. Victorian London Fog (black and oolong tea from Harney &amp; Sons)

8. Paris (black tea from Harney &amp; Sons)

When I brew my green tea ""properly"" it just feels like it's lacking that punch. I always use loose leaf and I recently ordered about 1kg of different high-quality green teas - before that I used Ahmad Tea (loose-leaf form, no teabags) - but regardless of the brand or the type, I just can't get enough of that overdone punch.  


I know steeping for longer releases more of the bioavailable green tea goodness, but I can't seem to find any info of the effects of the higher temperature. Any idea if I'm destroying some of the good stuff in my green tea this way?

I really enjoy matcha tea and I’ve been preparing it at home for several years. I am aware of the Japanese cultural background of matcha tea and I’ve been reading a lot about tea ceremonies and traditional pottery. I know the way I am preparing matcha is nowhere near how it is traditionally prepared, for example I tend to drink it with milk and also a different cup than the one I was preparing it in (that is significant to my problem)
Now, I am a design student and I have been assigned a project to create a pottery piece that focuses on practical use. I thought that creating a matcha bowl with a spout would be a good idea, because I tend to spill my matcha whenever I use a regular bowl to pour it into a cup. 
I did a good amount of research into chawan bowls and traditional Japanese pottery, and I wanted to do my design inspired by them. 
Now - is designing a non-traditional pottery for matcha cultural appropriation?

These two options look like something I'd want in terms of ease and functionality,  but I don't necessarily like the looks of them. Can anyone recommend a website that sells something like the following, but...better looking.

- Are there any differences (you know of) between the different Uniform models? There are those with and without the scales on top. Do the scales or their absence have an impact, maybe on this issue of the grind setting dial moving?

- Can you generally recommend this upgrade/set up? If one can get past the issue of the grind setting dial moving, I think this would be a great set up.

If so, what's the point of upgrading to SSP burrs with the Fellow? A problem of the fellow is that it doesn't really grind fine enough to do low dose V60s or filter brews that require slightly finer grind settings. If the SSP burrs give me the possibility to grind finer but it's better to not do that, what's the point?

I'm hoping you may be able to help me with a question.

Short version:
Will changing grinders from a Compak K3 to a Ceado E5P result in better espresso extraction consistency and quality?
Apart from grinding speed, would going to a larger burrset grinder (such as the Ceado) give me other grinding benefits?
Are flat burrs the same as flat burrs?

Long version:
I've been using my Compak K3 (for espresso) for around 10 years.
I generally single dose as I'm only making 2 cups a day.
In recent years I noticed that extraction times and consistency vary wildly day to day and intra day.... (It doesn't mean it wasn't occuring previously, I just didn't notice it).

Here begins my slippery slope of troubleshooting.

I've introduced dose weighing, purging before dosing, adding distribution tools, changed burrs in my grinder, paid A LOT of attention to my technique, kept logs and even changed machines...

I can't seem to iron out my shot (in)consistency and swapping over to a bottomless filter really highlighted how variable my extractions are.

So the only thing I haven't actually changed is my grinder (although I have changed burrs and made some mods to reduce retention) and me (but I have changed my technique).

The Ceado E5P seems like a great grinder in my price range, and I'm considering buying this but my reluctance is whether my extraction issues might be resolved by grinder change or I will just be even more frustrated, but with less money in my wallet.

I'm getting really weak taste from my Delonghi machine and it's pretty much been like that since I bought it. I've tried several different types of beans and different settings on the grinder but the coffee is always really weak tasting, you can hardly taste the coffee taste at all.

I had it down on the really low setting on the grinder but then it would struggle to get water through and it just became more bitter, not more coffee-tasting.

Does anyone else have the same experience? Could it be a faulty specimen or am I missing some setting on the machine?

Now a  month later, I have fully dived into the espresso world looking all  sorts of coffee machines and grinder setups.

I have now consolidated my choices (for now) down to 2 choices. Barista Express and the Gaggia Classic.

Firstly, the reason I'm even looking at the Baristia Express comes down to a few factors;

1. Price
2. In built grinder
3. Aesthetics
4. Can pull a Decent Shot (according to some)

On  the other hand the Barista Express also scares me, as I've heard that  it wont last as long as other machines. (eg. after warranty runs out  machine starts to breakdown)

The Gaggia Classic on the other hand has these benefits i believe

1. Open to modding (Dont know anything about coffee modding but would be intrigued
2. Pulls a much better shot (Ive heard?)
3. Better machine all round EXPECT I have to spend more on a grinder

Basically  it comes down to this. I like the Gaggia Classic MORE but the price I  would have to pay for a decent grinder is frustrating. Would I be better  off buying a Gaggia with a cheaper grinder like the Smart Grinder Pro  or is that not worth the money and I should just buy a Barista Express?

For example: Watching James Hoffmann's video on upgrading burrs, he mentions that putting SSP burrs into a Wilfa Uniform will result in really good coffee but the grinder will sometimes start changing its grind setting while grinding if one doesn't check it. He also mentions that putting SSP burrs into an Ode and grinding finer than the stock burrs are able to will put additional strain on the motor, because it's not what it's made for.

Probably the most frustrating experience so far has been trying to dial in my shots. I keep coming up against the same problem: I'll pull a shot using 16g on grind size 11, burr size 4, and will pull 32g of coffee in about 15 seconds. Okay, that's a little quick, so let's adjust the grind size to be more fine, going from 11 down just to 10. Now when I pull a shot, again using 16g, barely anything comes out. Why does adjusting the grind setting by a single level go from too fast to barely functional?

Hi,  
i am looking into getting my first hand grinder, trying to test methods and styles of coffee. I want to start saying that i am not looking to make espresso, other methods i will try to learn and use them at their best.  
I saw James' video about [best cheap grinder](https://youtu.be/QLEBfom0mhM?t=858) and rhino seems the best choice at the prince in my country of about 45euros (and also i can find ceramic burr to exchange if they get broken), after that i saw another budget-friendly grinder [the timemore c2](https://youtu.be/dn9OuRl1F3k?t=699) , which in my country is 65 euros ([i can buy normal stainless steel burr to change for 45euros and titanium ""plated"" burr for 50 euros](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cReTrimWFAQ) ).  
At this point i do not know what to do, i am new in this coffee-""business"" and do not what spent too much money on a grinder ( tho i read that a good grinder is important) but on speciality beans so i can taste as many as they are .  
I read that best burrs are titanium (as commander has ) because they do not dull so fast and have a better grinding and such, next i saw stainless steel is pretty sharp at first but dulls kinda fast and ceramics is less sharp than stainless but doesnt dull that fast.  
I would love for an opinion regarding c2 vs rhino and what about those e&amp;b burrs for c2, if you know any other budget friendly (about 60 more or less euroes ) grinders, i am happy to check them out.

I've been a happy and satisfied owner of a Breville Barista Express for the last 2 years. I am by no means a hardcore Aficionado/pro, but I've been really enjoying having a good espresso once a day, trying different beans and settings until I get it right etc. 

Now I moved to Europe from NA and couldn't bring my breville (kept it there for when I'm back).   
In the meantime, I still want to get my daily coffee but would prefer not to buy another barista express (or similar) because 1/ I don't have as much space in my new place, 2/ I'm only here for \~ 8 months and don't want to have a hard-time reselling when it's time to go back.

So, I'm thinking about 2 options : 

1. Moka Pot / Aeropress - Pros : Cheap, great space-wise, easy to clean, gets you a tasteful black coffee. Con : Doesn't get you a ""real"" espresso. 
2. Stainless-steel reusable pod + freshly ground coffee + Coffee Pod Machine (e.g nespresso) - Pros: Would get me my a espresso, some of the machines (e.g Essenza mini) don't take much space. Cons : Probably can't bag 9g of ground coffee in the reusable pod, so unsure how the end-product would taste like and I don't know which coffee pod machine to pick (would they all be the same if I use custom pods ?).  

What would be your advice between those 2 ? Any other alternative I should consider ? If your advice is to go with second option, what machine would fit my needs best ?

Welcome to the daily [/r/Coffee](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee) question thread!

There are no stupid questions here, ask a question and get an answer! We all have to start somewhere and sometimes it is hard to figure out just what you are doing right or doing wrong. Luckily, the [/r/Coffee](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee) community loves to help out.

Do you have a question about how to use a specific piece of gear or what gear you should be buying? Want to know how much coffee you should use or how you should grind it? Not sure about how much water you should use or how hot it should be? Wondering about your coffee's shelf life?

Don't forget to use the resources in our [wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/wiki)! We have some great starter guides on our [wiki ""Guides"" page](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/wiki/guides) and [here is the wiki ""Gear By Price"" page](http://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/wiki/gear#wiki_coffee_gear_suggestions) if you'd like to see coffee gear that [/r/Coffee](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee) members recommend.

Many of you might share stories about your trips to Europe or other places with the best coffee. I’ve tried the best coffee in my own house.

&amp;#x200B;

When my BF and I decided to purchase a house, the story started. It wasn’t a spontaneous decision. We decided to move in together when I rented a small studio apartment. I used to live there with my 2 cats and my York terrier. I really loved that apartment, it was close to my work, and it was downtown. But, my BF started to stay over there too often, and we decided that it was time to move in. He barely needed to pack his things coz most of his stuff was already at my place.

&amp;#x200B;

Still, there wasn’t enough space for all 5 of us, especially in the evening, when my BF wanted to watch a game on TV and I had to work. We started to look for a bigger place and found a lovely house for sale. We decided to combine our savings and apply for a mortgage. But, to make everything easier with the paperwork, we went to a City Hall and got married. That was a spontaneous decision.

&amp;#x200B;

When all papers were signed, and we got the keys, we started to pack everything. I went to our new place several times to clean everything. Still, it took us 3 days to move all our stuff into a new house. I also bought a lot of stuff online and ordered shipping to my new address. My new stylish coffee press would look perfect in the modern and urban-styled black-and-grey kitchen. I’m glad that I purchased it. Because during the moving process, I accidentally dropped the water tank of my old coffee maker.

&amp;#x200B;

So, on the first morning in a new house. We slept on our new mattress without a bed frame. I woke up early in the morning, before the sunrise. I unpacked my french press and filed some water. I made some coffee, found my favorite mug, and enjoyed this delightful drink in my own house.

Note that this thread will be weekly at least for the duration of the COVID-19 outbreak, since many roasters are running more specials than usual to drum up business.

We encourage everyone to post deals here especially since many roasters are holding specials to drive business affected by the COVID-19 outbreak. However, note that there will be zero tolerance for shady behavior. If you're found to be acting dishonestly here, your posting will be removed and we will consider banning you on the spot. If you yourself are affiliated with a business, please be transparent about it.

There are a few rules for businesses posting promotional material:

- You need to be active in /r/Coffee in a non-self-promotional context to participate in this thread. If it seems you are only here to promote your business in this thread, your submissions will be removed. Build up some /r/Coffee karma first. The Official Noob-Tastic Question Fest weekly thread, posted every Friday, would be a good place to start, and check out what is on the Front Page and jump in on some discussions. Please maintain a high ratio of general /r/Coffee participation to posts in this thread.

- If you are posting in this thread representing a business, please make sure to request your industry flair from the mods before posting.

- Don't just drop a link, say something worthwhile! Start a discussion! Say something about your roasting process or the exciting new batch of beans you linked to!

- Promotions in this thread must be actual deals/specials or new products. Please don't promote the same online store with the same products week after week; there should be something interesting going on. Having generally “good prices” does not constitute a deal.

- No crowdfunding campaigns (Kickstarter, Indiegogo, etc). Do not promote a business or product that does not exist yet. Do not bait people to ask about your campaign. Do not use this thread to survey /r/Coffee members or gauge interest in a business idea you have.

- Please do not promote affiliate/referral programs here, and do not post referral links in this thread.

- This thread is not a place for private parties to sell gear. /r/coffeeswap is the place for private party gear transactions.

- Top-level comments in this thread must be listings of deals. Please do not comment asking for deals in your area or the like.

- More rules may be added as needed. If you're not sure whether or not whatever you're posting is acceptable, message the mods and ask!

So I stumbled upon this reddit and found lots of people discussing coffee and techniques and all sorts of things like that and wanted to see if there was anything out there to help give me some input. I have stepped up and bought an espresso machine. I purchased the Philips 3200 Lattego machine last week and I am absolutely loving it so far. I am newer to this part of the coffee brewing. I have had my own grinder and buying whole beans but still nothing fancy and I was just using a Keurig to brew coffee every morning at home. I have started drinking a lot of milk drinks so I went with an upgrade.

I was wondering if there are any pointers, tips, techniques, things to look for, etc. that would help make this experience even better.

I got the machine about 3 months ago. It’s been perfect. I love it like a child.

I use a Eureka grinder.

I ran out of beans yesterday so I replaced them with some relatively fresh beans from a local roaster.

The first shot I pulled was no good, over extracted and slow. I adjusted the grind to be more coarse.

The second shot was good.

I steamed the milk and that was all normal. When I added it to the espresso, it curdled immediately.

I tried another shot, same thing.

I ran a cleaning cycle with cleaning tabs, flushed it with water, and left the machine over night.

This morning I had the same issue with the curdling milk.

I swapped the beans, same issue.

Tried different milk, same issue. (2% and 1% A2 milk, fresh).

Flushed the machine through the steam wand, hot water wand, and group head, probably 4L worth of water. No change.

I tested the steam only and hot water wand into milk and there is no curdling. I tested hot water from the group head and there is no curdling.

I tested two different portafilters and there is no difference.

I added 2 types of cold (undreamed) milk to an espresso shot and got curdling.

So it seems like something with the group head and espresso that is causing the curdling. Also of note, the pucks of espresso are more wet and have water sitting on top when I remove the porta filter from the group head. Not a lot, but it’s different than what I’m used to seeing. What I am used to seeing is a relatively clean/dry puck.

Having a few to no answers on my post in r/espresso, I am asking my questions here.
For the sake of this subreddit. I would plan, If I buy an espresso machine, to buy something like the Aeropress or a Chemex for larger, normal coffees? Any Tips about that?

I am from germany, a 19 year old Soldier and i am currently growing my love for coffee. 
I love good cappuccino or latte macchiato, but also black coffee, but only made from good machines (my dads jura makes some good tasting stuff)

Now, I wanna get into the espresso making, or firstly, espresso making. I never really tasted good espresso since no one I know has a good machine (does a jura s8 produce good espresso? not livin at my dads anymore...).

I need recommendations how to get to know if I like espresso and also an idea for a maybe-to-be espresso setup.

I've been looking at portable espresso makers for a few weeks since i need to get it home weekends.

My ideas: 

1. 9Barista. I LOVE the look and I am alone in drinking coffee, almost never will i need to pull multiple shots and it looks quite simple to handle

2. Flair machines in general. I think they look really cool and especially the 58 has some style to it, also making temperature handling easier, but they are not as portable and take more variables to be controlled and more cleaning, maybe more fussy.

3. The Robot. I don't quite like the design and don't know much about how many variables are to be controlled, how much cleaning and stuff is needed, please tell me more

4. The Rok, also I don't know much about it, please give me the same info as to the robot.

Starting an office job and now I'm getting really into it as a hobby.

I ordered some coffee that's a little darker than is ideal (for me) by mistake. It's roasted for espresso rather than filter and (despite how much I want one) I don't own an espresso machine, so I've been making do with my french press and recently my Clever dripper. It's still not THAT dark but it is on the darker end of medium and I've been getting a lot of harshness from it and a real astringent aftertaste no matter how I grind. At first I was brewing with boiling water, thinking that if it was too harsh I could grind coarser to extract less, but even grinding very coarse I still get that bitterness. Out of curiosity I tried adding cool water to my kettle just until the water wasn't boiling anymore and brewed with that, and it was SO much better. I got those caramelised flavours so much more clearly while still keeping those acidic berry notes and no harsh aftertaste. Even in a french press with a rather long steep time and no paper filter, the lower temperature made it taste so much less extracted and more balanced.

My question is: why? Why does it make such a big difference? I've watched the James Hoffmann video about brewing temperature (of course) and I've read what I can find about this and there seems to be a consensus that darker roasts favour lower temperatures. But as I understand it, for an immersion brew with a long steep time, the only thing temperature should affect is how fast you extract what is available from the grounds? I would expect that a 100°C brew and a 95°C brew left immersed for 15 minutes would both be about the same extraction level with the same grind size, and yet the results taste totally different. The only way I can think to explain it is that it has something to do with the evenness of my grind (which isn't great, but isn't terrible either - I'm using a 1zpresso JX-pro).

Has anyone else had the same experience? Do you know what could scientifically explain these results?

So summer has finally arrived in my area, and I’m interested in trying to make a refreshing cold drink, particularly one that would be perfect for get togethers. But, right now, I’m in a state of analysis paralysis and don’t even have a clue as to what coffee to use as my base.

Here’s all I’m looking for to start: a decaf roast, perfect to make a cold brew concentrate out of, that contains notes of berry, chocolate and nut.

Right now I’m considering the [chocolate raspberry decaf from Stone Street](https://stonestreetcoffee.com/products/chocolate-raspberry-decaf?currency=USD&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwm6KUBhC3ARIsACIwxBi5SOuvGYFqcS33-SUnIJc3Y4jkUtverczWPRHPYASmgMxtOTXWgXsaAsgOEALw_wcB&amp;variant=39679171559589) and the [decaf Ethiopia Worka Chelbesa natural from Onyx Coffee Lab](https://onyxcoffeelab.com/products/decaf-ethiopia-worka-chelbesa-natural), but…

1) I’m not sure if either would be suitable to make a cold brew concentrate with,

2) as on the nose as the chocolate raspberry decaf seems, the smallest amount they offer is 1 pound, and if I just want to sample it first, I don’t wanna be restricted to a pound if I end up not liking it, and

3) the roast from Onyx would be pretty pricy imo for a batch brew.

So, what do ya think? Any coffee suggestions? Any thoughts on the two roasts I’m currently considering? (And for bonus points, any drink ideas that you fancy that could give me some inspiration?)

I got on and off moments, but when I drink coffee I don’t joke.

On a working/typical day: I drink like 9 espresso (maybe more at times)

On weekends or non working days I tend to not drink any coffee
But if I’m seem fat in my mirror, then I’d have like 3-4 espressos around noon and maybe 2-3 more around 5pm (that coffee is drank instead of eating an unhealthy or healthy meal)

And yes I’m very jittery 😬 
I’m a shaker that shakes on its own in the vacuum of space and time.

I've been a coffee enthusiast for many years now but one thing I haven't touched in about 2 years is cold coffee. I'm not sure what is the current best option to get a good extraction in a cold coffee.   
Back 2 years ago it was using lots of coffee (like a 1:10 ratio) with room temp water for &gt;24h, coarsely ground to get some cold brew.  
Nowadays we know much more about how coffee extracts (or at least I know more than then), and that method does not sound viable at all, especially for light roasts. Cold water would probably have no way of extracting a ratio like 1:10 (too much bean for the water to handle).  Also why use a coarse grind? You can always filter your coffee later and you should make up for the cooler temp somehow, why not go super fine?  
As such, what is the best way to get a great cup of iced coffee? Can you achieve good extraction just through the standard cold brew immersion? (maybe by using a more realistic ratio like 1:16). Do the other options have a better chance to yield good coffee? Japanese style iced coffee? Maybe the cold drip?   
I know specialty coffee shops in my area use both cold brew and cold drip...

Beans either have this aroma and flavour (to varying strengths) or they don't which makes it all the more frustrating when I see notes that appear to have what I want, but it doesn't tick the box.

I bought myself a good espresso machine. I learned which espresso beans have the best taste and how to grind them to the correct fineness. I managed to insert the gadget with the grinds, known as a portafilter, into the espresso machine, lock it into place, turn on the machine and let her rip. Great espresso!

But I wanted a cappuccino. Sue wanted a latte. Time to figure out how to steam the milk.

Sue is always dieting, so she wants nonfat milk. I found out that low fat and nonfat milk foam really easily. Whole milk takes more practice. Same thing with half and half if you want a breve.

Some espresso machines have a built in steam nozzle and some don’t. You may need to buy a separate steamer. I recommend getting an espresso machine with one built in. Saves space.

The first thing to do is to put that stainless steel pitcher and milk into the refrigerator to get cold. Always start with them cold. And then my next learning curve came with remembering to fill the pitcher about a third to a half full. Milk expands really well when it’s steamed. It takes only once for it to foam up, overflow and hit the floor to remember to start with a pitcher no more than half full.

Start by putting the nozzle on the surface of the milk and turning the steam on full. The milk is going to begin to foam, so keep lowering the pitcher so that the nozzle is just under the surface of the milk. About a half inch will do fine. You can turn down the pressure when the foam really begins to rise, or just take the pitcher away. Now the milk is just about at the boiling point.

Now here is something important. Don’t let it boil. This is another way to get the milk to overflow the pitcher. Or even worse, it will taste burnt. Ugh. Nasty.

Your steamed milk should have little bubbles all the way through it, and there should be a light foam on the top. There you are. That’s it. Now you go make whatever espresso drink you want.

I’ve had a Sage machine (as per the title) which had a faulty heater after 8 months. It’s taken 7 weeks (weekly phone calls to Sage and Coffee Classics and emails) to finally get a replacement machine.

Anyway long story short, old one settings noted and then boxed up to return, new one setup, same settings, same coffee beans, same model. Grinds terribly and then it doesn’t pour out of the portafilter. Anyway after lots of coffee setting amendments and gone through 500g of coffee and bunch of milk, I decided to look at it logically. What is going wrong where. Okay so the water isn’t extracting out of the portafilter (most of the time no water), tested without the PF in it, works fine. So water is fine, tested PF without coffee and just water, come out fine. Coffee is the issue, what’s different? Same company beans and the grind was a lot slower, so where it usually would take 9 seconds to grind into the PF, it took 18-26 seconds on the setting we used to have. Odd. So I unboxed the old machine and checked both grinders, completely different.

Tested the old machine to grind the beans and then use new machine to extract and it worked as expected!

Anyone explain why the same coffee machine model, less than a year apart have different grinders? The old one was a lot more protruded (stood out a lot more) - new one, both outside and inside burr were a lot more flat, which was causing the grinder to not grind the beans very well, clumpy.

But I can’t understand why they are so different?

I’ll upload a pic of the differences. Raised a ticket to sage to complain too but their service is terrible.

Kruve recommends that grind sizes to be from 400μm to 1200μm. So I started grinding 8 grams of beans with 30 clicks away (CCW) from the zero setting of the Comandante.The result wasn't very satisfying and lots of coarser grounds remained in the upper chamber of the Kruve sifter. Below you can find my best results. Also note that my coffee beans are a medium roast blend from a local roastery.

Comandante setting: 22 clicks
8 gr of beans
0.75 gr waste (mostly coarser than 1200μm grounds)

Comandante setting: 20 clicks
8 gr of beans
0.57 gr waste (mostly finer than 400μm grounds)

Comandante setting: 19 
8 gr of beans
0.48 gr watse (almost only finer than 400μm grounds)

And so, going against some people's advice, I tried using a food processor (blender) to get it finer and finer. The coffee became extra fine and the coffee machine started to choke (the pressure gauge with the Baratza grind only goes up to 5\~7 bars of pressure while going over 10 with the finer grind), with a minimum of 25 seconds of brew time and some going over 1 minute for a 1:2 ratio. But I've watched a few videos online and it seemed as if the grind they were using weren't much finer than what my Baratza grinder was putting out.

It's good, definitely better than most over-roasted coffee I can get at 2go places around here, but still lacking a bit: I think I'm mainly struggling with underextraction.

* Beans: [https://www.tchibo.de/privat-kaffee-latin-grande-p400104177.html?forceP=WEBSHOP](https://www.tchibo.de/privat-kaffee-latin-grande-p400104177.html?forceP=WEBSHOP)

* Grønenberg stainless steel french press
* water hardness around 8° dH/235 ppm

 

Preparation:

* 12-13 grams of beans, grind on 22 clicks
* Kettle on 95°c (203°F) 
* In: \~230ml of water in the french press
* Short bloom, then \~4 minutes of brewing time, stirring once or twice, not pressing the grounds, inspired by hoffmann method
* Out: \~210ml of coffee in the cup

&amp;#x200B;

I still think there might be a little too much acidity and a slightly weaker arrival than I would like, and from pourover I know these beans can deliver a bit more. I'm not sure how to adjust though, I already reduced the bean dosage and changed the grind setting (I started at 25 clicks).

Specifically, I'm looking to switch from a hand grinder to an electric grinder. I'll try to give you guys as much information on my current grinding and brewing:

I currently own an 1Zpresso JX Pro hand grinder. I'm quite happy with it as it produces vastly better distributions than the cheap Hario grinder I used before and because it's easy to use. I opted for a hand grinder because it's better value for money in terms of grinding performance and I didn't know yet how far I was going to go with my ""coffee game"". I only make filter coffee at the moment.

There are two reasons why I wish to buy a new grinder that is electric:

1) As I use my grinder that much and I expect to be grinding more often for more than one cup at a time, the convenience of an electric grinder is something I'd value greatly.

2) While I know that my current grinder is pretty good, there's room to grow. So as my experience and ""brewing skills"" grow, I thought I'd make an investment into my hobby by buying a good electric grinder that could last me for a bit.

A couple of things that may be relevant for which grinder to choose:

- I live in Europe (Switzerland), so I can only buy what can be shipped to Germany or Switzerland and I can only use a machine with the correct voltage.

- As mentioned, I currently only make filter coffee, not espresso but I could imagine switching to espresso at some point (once I can afford it).

- Needless to say, I'd wish for an improvement in performance compared to my current grinder, so entry level electric grinders in a similar price range as my grinder would be out of the question.

- If I choose a filter focused grinder, I'd want it to be able to reliably grind fine enough. I remember Hoffmann's review of the Fellow Ode, saying that he worries that it doesn't grind fine enough for a one cup V60. My Aeropress and Moka pot are even finer than my one cup V60, so maybe a grinder that is made to be able to do espresso but able to do filter well as well would be good (?), something like the Niche.

I'd maybe still be able to improve the flavor of the coffee by extracting more evenly, preventing some potential bitter or sour compounds I don't want.

Is there a way to actually measure evenness of extraction? I'm sure someone with enough experience in tasting coffee will be able to tell the difference between the same coffee, with one of the two being more evenly extracted (better grinder, immersion, better technique, etc.).

I brewed two cups today, and thought I'd share my results! 

First cup was a medium-light Ethiopian natural I roasted at home. In the V60, I was getting pretty balanced cups but maybe a touch under extracted. In the Blue Bottle Dripper, (BBD, henceforth) as soon as I lifted the dripper off the cup I was smacked in the face by the aroma of hot sugar. (Think cotton candy.) Flavor-wise, it was what you expect from an Ethiopian natural. Jammy, aggressively floral. My favorite thing about it was the body, though. I've never had a cup of filter coffee that was so syrupy! It was pretty high strength, and veeery high extraction at ~24%. 

Second cup was a darker roasted blend I bought from a new coffee shop in the area. It's the one they brew in house for filter coffee, and I think it's a great example of a specialty dark roast! (Dark-ish, really.) I didn't measure extraction, but I was still impressed. There was a candy banana note I never tasted in my V60 or Aeropress cups, and again, much heavier body. This could be down to different filter paper, but either way, I like it! 

My personal experience with the V60 is that you usually have to trade high extraction for clarity. You can get a sweeter cup, but usually with less flavor separation than a bright cup. So far, it seems like you don't make that trade with the BBD. 

A few caveats: with only two brews down, I may find things to dislike about the dripper with time. Coming from a plastic V60, I'm nervous about dropping or breaking. Some coffees may benefit from a bit lower EY, and I don't know if that will be easy to do on the BBD. Also, it doesn't fit neatly on the glass body of my French Press, which I usually use as a server. For all that, though, I'm super stoked to explore what it can do!

I drink between two/three V60s a day on a 16/250 ratio and had been using the Wilfa exclusively for V60 or AeroPress methods for about two years.  I pre-ordered the Niche in March and it was delivered last week.  I am aware that popular opinion is that the Wilfa is better for V60 and the Niche for espressos but I have to admit I didn’t expect such a marked difference in V60 quality.
 
My main objection with the Wilfa was the noise and that it scatters grinds everywhere when you pull the basket out.  In these respects the Niche has it beaten but that’s about it as far as I can tell.
 
I’m grinding light roast beans at setting 45 on the Niche and although the grinds look about right and certainly appear ‘fluffier’ I am surprised by the amount of fines the Niche is producing.  I would hardly get any with the Wilfa but now the paper on the V60 is black with fine sludge.  I am not convinced the coffee is any more delicious with the Niche.
 
Maybe I am doing it wrong?
 
I’m going to buy a Flair 58 and get into espresso and perhaps at that point I’ll ‘get’ the Niche.

I'm new to espresso and still practicing. Using my Gaggia Classic Pro (with 9bar opv mod) and a Sette 30, but I still haven't got one single good espresso shot. I tried dark roast, different grind sizes from 10 on the Sette, to 8 with different dosings (15,5g - 17g) in the double basket which came with the GCP. All within 20-30s tasted way too bitter, so I tried a medium roast. Same story, all way too bitter. Now I tried a lighter roast, again different grind settings from 9 to 5 and dosings from 15,5g - 17,5g, but these were all waaaay too sour/acidic. Tried shots from 22ish seconds - 38s. Haven't tasted anything 'sweet' in all the shots I pulled.

I think I will earn a reward for watching all the youtube tutorials on how to dial in, but still no reward for good espresso...

Many, many sources on the web indicate that the weight of an espresso shot is 1oz, a double espresso naturally therefore being 2oz. This equates for us metric folks as approximately 30ml/30g per shot, 60g for a double espresso. The grounds on the input side being around 9g for a single shot, 18g for a double.

My confusion is that many, many other sources, particularly on YT, indicate that the 'God Shot' of espresso, is 18g in and based upon a 1:2 ratio, 36-40g out, in 25-30 seconds. Now even my basic maths, can see that 36g is significantly different, as a measure of double espresso to the 2oz/60g standard measure, quoted by innumerable sources.

It always makes me incredibly nauseous, and it's a huge trigger for my IBS.  
Over the years my tolerance went down so eventually I quit coffee entirely. Now I exclusively consume energy drinks, which give me zero of those side effects. 

  
I've tried:  
\- different brands  
\- more milk, less milk, plant milk, black  
\- different types (instant, brewed, etc.)  
\- artificial sweetener, sugar, honey, or no sweetener at all  
\- diluted  
\- hot/cold  
\- with/without food  
\- with/without extra hydration  
None of this helped. I found the best way I can drink it is instant, with lots of milk and water, after a meal. But it still makes me very sick.

So I'm definitely not lactose intolerant, and the issue isn't the caffeine as energy drinks are fine, I can't figure out what it is about coffee that does this to me.

In this weekly thread, industry folk can post upcoming deals or other promotions their companies are holding, or promote new products to /r/Coffee subscribers! Regular users can also post deals they come across. Come check out some of the roasters and other coffee-related businesses that Redditors work for!

Note that this thread will be weekly at least for the duration of the COVID-19 outbreak, since many roasters are running more specials than usual to drum up business.

We encourage everyone to post deals here especially since many roasters are holding specials to drive business affected by the COVID-19 outbreak. However, note that there will be zero tolerance for shady behavior. If you're found to be acting dishonestly here, your posting will be removed and we will consider banning you on the spot. If you yourself are affiliated with a business, please be transparent about it.

There are a few rules for businesses posting promotional material:

- You need to be active in /r/Coffee in a non-self-promotional context to participate in this thread. If it seems you are only here to promote your business in this thread, your submissions will be removed. Build up some /r/Coffee karma first. The Official Noob-Tastic Question Fest weekly thread, posted every Friday, would be a good place to start, and check out what is on the Front Page and jump in on some discussions. Please maintain a high ratio of general /r/Coffee participation to posts in this thread.

- If you are posting in this thread representing a business, please make sure to request your industry flair from the mods before posting.

- Don't just drop a link, say something worthwhile! Start a discussion! Say something about your roasting process or the exciting new batch of beans you linked to!

- Promotions in this thread must be actual deals/specials or new products. Please don't promote the same online store with the same products week after week; there should be something interesting going on. Having generally “good prices” does not constitute a deal.

- No crowdfunding campaigns (Kickstarter, Indiegogo, etc). Do not promote a business or product that does not exist yet. Do not bait people to ask about your campaign. Do not use this thread to survey /r/Coffee members or gauge interest in a business idea you have.

- Please do not promote affiliate/referral programs here, and do not post referral links in this thread.

- This thread is not a place for private parties to sell gear. /r/coffeeswap is the place for private party gear transactions.

I’m completely blind and was wondering if there were any low vision or fellow blind coffee lovers on this forum that could help out with some input. Even sighted folks for that matter…

I’ve been considering getting an espresso machine. Currently, I’m using this AeroPress recipe https://www.javapresse.com/blogs/aeropress/aeropress-espresso-recipe which can do a semi-decent job, but I’d like to upgrade to something that can actually pull real espresso shots. Is anyone who’s completely blind successfully using a quality espresso machine? For the sighted folks, are you using a machine where you don’t have to pay attention to what you’re doing to operate it or could get away with not having to look at what you’re doing for example? 

I know as a blind person I right off the bat have to stay away from machines with touch screens and capacitive buttons. My preference is to also stay away from anything that relies on any sort of app or Wifi connectivity.

I’ve used a moka pot in the past and wasn’t a real fan. I also don’t need something with all sorts of bells or whistles like an integrated grinder, frother and scale as I already have a Baratza Virtuoso and accessible kitchen scale. Really just something that’s capable of pulling two shots and has a removable water tank to measure out the water I suppose.

I was gifted a Ninja coffee maker for Christmas that had all sorts of functions, but it unfortunately had one of those capacitive buttons with a menu you had to cycle through to pick what you wanted to do. There was no way I could use it.

I know you can go down the rabbit hole when it comes to espresso, but I’d like to keep my budget around $600 max.

If anyone’s got any suggestions or hands-on input on any models that can be operated mainly with tactile buttons and or switches/levers, I’d appreciate it.

Having been exclusively a tea drinker for all my adult life, I've recently decided to put my toe in the water of coffee...what a revelation, flavour! 

Typically I began the day with a 12oz (350ml) Starbucks Americano and due to covid, decided to go the Moka Pot route and now have a 6-cup pot, which yields about 240-260ml, the basket taking around 25g of ground coffee. Moka Pot coffee is of course somewhat stronger than an Americano and I've been adding around 80ml of hot milk, to bring me up to my usual 120z cup of joe!

However, reading on other sites, it appears that the 6-cup moka is really aimed at two people, with the 3 cup Moka Pot recommended for one person.

What am I missing? Am I doing something really unusual, unhealthy by having a complete 6-cup Moka Pot's worth of coffee?

Hey guys!!

I'm very new into the ""coffee culture"" (but getting addicted fast!) - so my apologies if i say something ignorant.

I've made a friend in Indonesia that was selling coffee green bean powder, not roasted, and having very good success as the product is of very high quality and nobody seems to produce it the same way.

But the machines she uses to grind the beans aren't up to the task as they keep breaking.

She's getting discouraged which is a shame because with the success the product has, she can set herself and her family up for life if only she can continue producing.

So...

I come to you all, coffee experts, to ask:

does any of you know of a supplier, custom maker, or available machine capable of pulverising this rock like beans?

My friend has an Appia at their coffee shop that had a steam leak from the vacuum pressure valve (no biggie, disassembled it, cleaned it and reinstalled it)

However, when I asked them to turn the machine on again - to check for any pressure leaks during warm up, the pump would engage and disengage with that audible ‘click’ multiple times..(in my thought process from owning a Victoria Arduino Adonis) this would happen once to allow the boiler to refill to the required level before heating the water, however with my friend’s machine, it seemed to just constantly click [engage] on(or off?) repeatedly for 10-20 mins. With a frequency of 3-5seconds between each pulse (engagement).

I presume that there may be either a problem with the pump itself, an associated solenoid (or the [Auto-level Sensor - Part # 09000003]) however, rather than just changing parts here and there (a layman repair technique), I was wondering if anyone has had a similar problem, and could provide either insight (about the problem, symptoms and solution) or to clarify a way to accurately diagnose if this is the case?

For example - is there a voltage / resistance that can be measured with a multimeter to check that the sensor is indeed working, and if the voltage / resistance is fluctuating correctly with the operation of the machine?

The rapid engaging / disengaging (off and on -&gt; ‘clicking’) isn’t actually adding water to the boiler at all, and I suspect that it is impeding the warm-up time of the machine, and potentially wearing out the pump with it’s intermittent operation.

I haven’t timed the machine’s warm up, that can be done - if required, but any information that could be of assistance would be greatly appreciated.

I'm currently looking at a used Gaggia Coffee Deluxe being sold near me for $75. Currently my ""espresso"" fix is being filled with just OK aeropress concentrated shots and too much money to my local coffee shop, so I'm thinking about biting the bullet and picking this one up. The seller says it works fine, but I'm totally new to espresso machines - I'm a flash pourover and cold brew kinda gal- and I have no idea what I should be looking for once I get it/if I get it. 

A few questions-

Between this and a used Flair NEO for the same price, which is more capable, steam wand aside?
I've heard it's similar to the Gaggia Classic but without the 3 way valve. I won't need that if I'm just looking at doing plain ol' double shots, right?
Same with the frothing wand, I'm an iced shaken espresso and iced latte drinker because... Texas, so if the wand has issues will it impact the whole thing, or is it fine?
What sort of issues should I be on the lookout for in terms of fixing/replacing? Are replacement parts still readily available or will it be a new old stock situation?
My current grinder is a trusty Porlex Mini that fits in my aeropress (it goes with me home, to hotels, to friends houses, the like)... will that on the finest settings be sufficient for the time being? Or would I be better off looking for a dedicated espresso grinder secondhand? I'm a college student so my budget is sort of limited for anything nicer.

I'm considering a few options on used machines at the moment, all at a similar price. I'm based in South Africa so available options are somewhat limited. (I'll do USD price equivalents for ease of evaluation) 

I'd appreciate any insights, warnings or recommendations on these machines:

Gaggia Platinum Swing - $175

Gaggia Naviglio Deluxe - $155

Saeco Talea Ring - $125

Delonghi ecam 23.210 - $185

So I've had these machines for 7 months. For the first 6 they were great, I could really dial in the flavor using different settings. Recently though, the coffee has become bitter and bland. Worse than Foldgers, Keurig or any of the inedible stuff you can buy.

I've been buying the same roasts(mainly from social coffee in Toronto- they do light to medium roasts and their beans are well reviewed). The roast im using currently I used to grind at a fairly fine 35 on my SGP and it was fairly fruit forward but above everything quite smooth and sweet. Now regardless of grind setting(I've tried everything between a fine 30 and massively course 60) its trash just slightly less bitter at the upper end. I've played with every setting on mybrew(currently at 196f for temp, 30 second bloom and slow flow) and the gold setting but it changes nothing. I've descaled my machine two weeks ago, I always rinse out each component and I clean my grinder weekly.

There was a fiery debate about the definition of iced coffee so I'll TLDR that for you here as to my definition: Coffee that is traditional hot brewed, then cooled (preferably quickly) and then once cooled, poured over ice and drank.

After many months of experimenting with both at home I have come to a realization about cold brew: It comes out SO MUCH better (IMO) when you use a light roast. I've been doing a 96 hour steep in the fridge, and have been coming to realize that when you use a darker roast it starts to taste further from what I associate with a ""coffee"" flavor, whereas when you use a medium or light roast there are a lot more flavors that come through. I'm not a fan of those Trader Joe's cold brew concentrates - and I find that that's what the darker roast CBs come to taste like.

Not a forever convert, I like to switch off between both CB and IC (TBH I'm a sucker for a standard black Starbucks Iced Coffee - they really have it down), but certainly less of a CB hater now.

So I have a big steel french press, it comfortably makes two full mugs and its full capacity was listed (by the seller on Amazon) as 1.2 L. I really like steel because glass cracks easily in the dishwasher.

I also have a Krups burr grinder. So I expected some nice coffee - but am failing to make it. Instead, it's either watery or bitter.

The Internet (tm) says use coarser grinds, somewhat large amounts of coffee, limit brewing to 5 minutes. But it gets bitter. Smaller amounts with a coarse grind get watery; with a finer grind, bitter again.

I did also start preheating the steel french press first by keeping some freshly-boiled water in it, covered, for a minute while rocking the press. Things got somewhat better but not a lot.

So what's the secret here? How can I work out the formula for coffee that would be full-bodied but not bitter?

I did google now and there is that James Hoffman video with the idea of stirring after a  few minutes and then just throwing away what remains on top.

Fellow just released their drops text-to-order subscription service which seems to be an interesting take on the whole subscription idea. But beyond them, most of the services feel the same. 

While I usually just go out and buy locally roasted coffee, I can see where subscription services could be useful. Specifically in places where there aren't any good roasters or limited variety. 

For people who use subscription services, what's the main driver for doing so? Is it mainly a convenience factor? Wanting to try new roasters from across the country? Or simply the easiest way to get well roasted coffee in your neck of the woods.

Bit of a noob question here, but **what does this ""ring"" thing does?**

So I just got this Barista Space Hand Grinder. It has some kind of rubber placed here normally ([look](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1921/8479/products/32833_large.jpg?v=1626257271)), so it is not visible immediately.

I never had a proper grinder, so I did not know it was there. I started grinding. And I noticed it moves left and right. Because I grabbed it relatively firmly and put some power into grinding, it changed my grind size, until it was so small it was not grinding.

I get it, hold it in a way that doesn't change the size.But... **Why is it there? Why does it move left and right, allowing me to change the size when I don't want to change it?**

Actually, the way I hold things allows me to change it even when I'm opening the coffee tank. It's just weird.

Bit of a noob question here, but **what does this ""ring"" thing does?**

So I just got this Barista Space Hand Grinder. It has some kind of rubber placed here normally ([look](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1921/8479/products/32833_large.jpg?v=1626257271)), so it is not visible immediately. 

I never had a proper grinder, so I did not know it was there. I started grinding. And I noticed it moves left and right. Because I grabbed it relatively firmly and put some power into grinding, it changed my grind size, until it was so small it was not grinding.

I get it, hold it in a way that doesn't change the size.  
But... **Why is it there? Why does it move left and right, allowing me to change the size when I don't want to change it?**

Actually, the way I hold things allows me to change it even when I'm opening the coffee tank. It's just weird.

Hi all, I hope this is ok to post here, I can't seem to find anywhere else!

In my tired fog this morning, I made a pot of coffee using my Smeg drip coffee machine ([https://www.smeg.com/drip-filter-coffee-machine](https://www.smeg.com/drip-filter-coffee-machine)) WITHOUT putting the damn pot into the dock. So I came back into the kitchen and obviously the coffee was all over the machine and counter. I cleaned it all up and turned it off at the mains, took the basket out etc.

My question now is, is it safe to use? I'm worried that the coffee has gotten under the hot plate (it almost certainly has as when I leave it for a few hours there's a small puddle of coffee under the machine) and that will make it like, I dunno, go on fire or explode or something. I might sound a bit silly here, I'm just not totally sure how it works...

We don't really wanna start taking it apart if we can help it, but should we?

I'm extremely sensitive to bitter tastes (supertaster), but I like aspects of black coffee, and I realized that I don't think I ever actually enjoyed any of the strong coffee I drank. 

I guiltily enjoyed 'weak' diner coffee, fast food coffee or the cheap coffee you'd get in those little teabag filters in hotel rooms. I tried my hand at pour-over, thinking that it would help me control the strength more, but that was too much work for multiple cups of coffee.

coarser grind and multiple pours VS fine grind and single pour (after bloom)

this always intrigued me as to the fundamental differences between the two

james hoffman/ scott rao seems to prefer the single pour, while we have all seen brewers cup champion recipes mainly doing multiple pours

my understanding is that coarser grinds act as a ""safety net"" to avoid over-extraction in several ways

* lower temperature, heat loss is greater when you allow the water to drain before pouring again
* coarser grinds less prone to overextraction
* a bed with coarser grinds channel less

downside is that you are putting a ceiling on the flavours available for extraction as you are leaving some coffee unavailable for extraction at the centre of the coarser grinds.

I lost my taste and smell due to COVID in April 2020 (765 days/25 months not that I'm counting). I've slowly gotten used to life without them and they don't show any signs of returning so I wanted to ask if anyone has advice on how we can still enjoy coffee without being able to smell it.

Do you have a question about how to use a specific piece of gear or what gear you should be buying? Want to know how much coffee you should use or how you should grind it? Not sure about how much water you should use or how hot it should be? Wondering about your coffee's shelf life?

Don't forget to use the resources in our [wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/wiki)! We have some great starter guides on our [wiki ""Guides"" page](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/wiki/guides) and [here is the wiki ""Gear By Price"" page](http://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/wiki/gear#wiki_coffee_gear_suggestions) if you'd like to see coffee gear that [/r/Coffee](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee) members recommend.

Note that this thread will be weekly at least for the duration of the COVID-19 outbreak, since many roasters are running more specials than usual to drum up business.

We encourage everyone to post deals here especially since many roasters are holding specials to drive business affected by the COVID-19 outbreak.

- You need to be active in /r/Coffee in a non-self-promotional context to participate in this thread. If it seems you are only here to promote your business in this thread, your submissions will be removed. Build up some /r/Coffee karma first.

- If you are posting in this thread representing a business, please make sure to request your industry flair from the mods before posting.

- Don't just drop a link, say something worthwhile! Start a discussion! Say something about your roasting process or the exciting new batch of beans you linked to!

- Promotions in this thread must be actual deals/specials or new products. Please don't promote the same online store with the same products week after week; there should be something interesting going on. Having generally “good prices” does not constitute a deal.

i am in need for help regarding casa v maintenance and care. my gf doesn't do anything to take care of machine and decided to get some knowledge regarding this.

i got couple of questions:

&amp;#x200B;

\- what are good products for cleaning entire machine? (not just grouphead with back flushing) - but inside parts/pipes etc

&amp;#x200B;

\- shall i replace silicon rings in group head? (attaching image below - there is thick red one and thin one inside group head that are quite hard at the moment and not the flexible anymore. is it worth changing?)

&amp;#x200B;

\- from the image attached below - how could i clean the limescale? back flushing doesn't help and i do not want to scratch/damage it. hard brush that came together with machine does not work either. soaking with solution is impossible - hard place to soak in

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

tried checking lots of videos but couldn't find specific in depth guide for these answers. ecm community is not that big!

I  want to dive into the espresso world. I have been looking for hand  grinders and portable machines for a while. I travel a lot and so  portable tools are my focus. To begin with, I have started by ordering  the Picopresso. I think one of the best portable coffee machines is the  Picopresso. When it comes to the hand grinders, I got stuck with  indecision.

Which product is best suited for making espresso? Some of them -&gt;J-Max, Jx Pro, K-Max, Comandante C40, Molent,Timemore X etc.

How  many microns will I need for each click to extract all flavours from  coffee beans and get a well-balanced taste with good complexity and  body? 8.8(J-Max), 12,5 (Jx Pro), 15(comandante with red clix, or 30  without it), 22 ( K-Series) etc. Which product will best combined with  the Picopresso? which one offers long-last using? These are some of my  questions. While struggling with the question, I watched a comparison  (the link is below) of Comandante and Jx-Max in terms of making espresso  today.

I will probably prefer the  Comandante option even if it requires more effort than others. After  this long consideration, I just wanted to share this comparison video  that helped me decide what to do. I will be grateful if you let me know  your comments about my decision.

Okay, so I am not a coffee super fan, at least not yet. Several months ago when looking for replacements for my old Keurig, an machine I got when I was younger and never used, I got another Keurig called the K-cafe, which was advertised to make lattes and cuppaccinos and froth milk. So, I got that, and then went down this weird rabbit hole of looking for other machines when I realized the “espresso” was really just concentrated coffee, and if I’m being completely honest I was just excited to try making cool designs but realized that Crema is a necessary component to latte art, and the k-cafe fake-espresso has none of that. It’s also a cost issue, since the pods cost a lot. I fixed the cost issue with a refillable pod, but it’s extremely specific on the grind type (for instance, I can’t buy cafe bustelo ground in bulk) but then I just thought, there has to be something that can accepts ground coffee, is instant and convenient like Keurig, and makes both coffee and espresso shots. When I type “coffee+espresso” maker, they all have a traditional drip-coffee machine, and I literally don’t have the time in the day to wait on those to fill up.

I currently have an aeropress for travel (that I recently learned I was not letting it steep properly), a Moka pot, and several cheaper espresso machines at home, with a super automatic Espressione Concierge at my office (because it's easy). 

I usually do 2:1 milk (not steamed or frothed) to coffee ratio. Sometimes I'll add a sweetener but not always. 

I also have been traveling to various cafes and trying different things. If they roast themselves, I'll just get a simple cappuccino, but if not I'll try a flavored latte (which obviously masks the coffee but if they're not roasting I should try what makes that cafe special right?)

This is the only image I have of the absolute unit. I can remember it was hooked to a double-filtered tap supply and despite having a bunch of different menu settings, was only ever used for regular and decaf coffee. I asked my father and grandmother and both can't remember what brand it was, but that it was acquired in the mid-90s through a restaurant supplier, of whom also delivered to them regular 6-month shipments of Lacas coffee, ketchup/mustard packets, sugar packets, and the usual assortment of pink/yellow/blue sweetener packets to boot.

In its lifetime it only ever broke down once, and it was something to do with a manufacturer defect in a seal that led to quite a bit of water on the floor-- covered under service warranty, of course. aside from this, it was a workhorse, and the employees who frequented it had the machine dialed in for a perfect 8oz cup every time (or so says my grandmother). I can partly blame this machine for my love of coffee today, as I was an early enjoyer (for the time) at 8 years old. As a kid with the ADHD type that calmed down with caffeine, coffee was my savior, no matter what it tasted like.

Despite the image depicting such, the machine was not coin-op enabled, and the coin/change mechanism was disabled if it had it installed to begin with, something that slips my own memory. I can remember it taking a time to warm up, and I think it used straight-up pre-ground coffee as I do remember the inside having a waste grounds container. However, I can't make out the brand label on the front-top-left to save my life, and my google-fu must be weak in this field as I'm not able to find any images of commercial-grade machines from this era to get even an inkling of what brands to look at. 

Honestly I'm doing this for nostalgia's sake, to get some better pictures and even a video if it exists. I'm sorry for the graininess of the image, it was taken on a 3.2MP Kodak camera of the time and not on the highest quality setting it could have been. If this looks in any way shape or form familiar to anyone, or if anyone has any clues toward which brand to look at, it would help a lot towards the removal of a headscratcher I've had for a couple of years now.

If this isn't the right subreddit to post this in, a recommendation of where to crosspost it would also be beneficial. I don't know if r/cafe would be more proper but it is 4AM and I'm losing sleep over this.

Typically coffee keeps you awake, focused and energized (the caffeine rush if you will) and then comes the crash, where the brain produces enough adenosine to fight the effects of caffeine. So you feel tired and sleepy or just feel less energized than before you drank coffee.

My situation is that but erase the first part.

I while back I got really into maple lattes after watching a coffee shop on tv who are known for them. I found the flavor combination to be delicious but when I tried remaking it myself I came across an issue, the maple flavor was to delicate you could hardly taste it and I only got the maple syrup flavor on the back end.

After some research, I found that the maple flavor comes from the darker syrups, not only the darker syrups but also syrups extracted from later in the season. I don't use artificial maple syrups and I wouldn't say I buy the top quality since it can get pricey.

This being said, I had the idea of maybe adding maple extract to maple syrup itself and then continuing to use it as a syrup for my lattes. Will this add a weird maple flavor to the latte or can this actually enhance the maple flavor of the syrup itself to make it a little more dominate in the final product?

As title says I am looking to upgrade my current setup of a gaggia viva style + a krups lowend burr grinder to something that is less cumbersome to use, cause the krups can't grind directly into a portafilter and produces better tasting drinks.

We almost exclusively drink lattes or cappucinos, but most of the time lately it just ends up being café a lait's as I find that the style's steam arm is eh at best, and my old nespresso automatic milk fother takes ages to clean up cause it burns milk after 1 go.

I was mainly looking at sage/breville machines cause of their automatic milk frothing function, and ended up ordering a bambino plus cause one place has it for around 330$ instead of 450$, but because they are taking their sweet time shipping it out, i started to look around more (had recently had issues with a different place not doing anything with my order for 2 months so i'm always suspicious nowadays when sites take long to even start shipping).

I was planning to pair it with a Mignon Classic Manuale/Silenzio (and a non pressurized filter if it doesn't come with one ofc), but this is where I started to wonder about how much the grinder would matter if it's almost 100% milk drinks and never straight up shots, and if I would be better of with just a lower end grinder like the SGP or even their dose control (which I could get from an another place in a pack where the machine is essentaly the same discounted price).

Any help would be appreciated

Welcome to the daily [/r/Coffee](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee) question thread!

There are no stupid questions here, ask a question and get an answer! We all have to start somewhere and sometimes it is hard to figure out just what you are doing right or doing wrong. Luckily, the [/r/Coffee](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee) community loves to help out.

Do you have a question about how to use a specific piece of gear or what gear you should be buying? Want to know how much coffee you should use or how you should grind it? Not sure about how much water you should use or how hot it should be? Wondering about your coffee's shelf life?

Don't forget to use the resources in our [wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/wiki)! We have some great starter guides on our [wiki ""Guides"" page](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/wiki/guides) and [here is the wiki ""Gear By Price"" page](http://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/wiki/gear#wiki_coffee_gear_suggestions) if you'd like to see coffee gear that [/r/Coffee](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee) members recommend.

I while back I got really into maple lattes after watching a coffee shop on tv who are known for them. I found the flavor combination to be delicious but when I tried remaking it myself I came across an issue, the maple flavor was to delicate you could hardly taste it and I only got the maple syrup flavor on the back end.

After some research, I found that the maple flavor comes from the darker syrups, not only the darker syrups but also syrups extracted from later in the season. I don't use artificial maple syrups and I wouldn't say I buy the top quality since it can get pricey.

This being said, I had the idea of maybe adding maple extract to maple syrup itself and then continuing to use it as a syrup for my lattes. Will this add a weird maple flavor to the latte or can this actually enhance the maple flavor of the syrup itself to make it a little more dominate in the final product?

Mainly takeout, with maybe 5-10 seats. And also serve coffee. My initial idea was to invest in a decent, lower end espresso machine (Conti CC100), grinder, batch brewer etc. My partner, who has worked as a barista for a few years, would be in charge of serving customers and making coffees. We did realise we'd have to probably hire someone else to help out in FoH. 

I'm now thinking, however, to only serve batch brew (for now). The thing is, I'd rather avoid the costs of an espresso set-up, the cost of hiring someone else to help at the front, and the possibility that the coffee might not always be the greatest because of time pressure. But with batch brew, my partner could serve, make cups of batch brew, and also help in the kitchen. No other employee needed. 

Of course, I'd make sure there's space to buy an espresso machine later on, when we're in a certain flow running the business, and we're in a position to hire more people. But for the beginning, I was thinking we could just focus on high quality filter, and give a choice of two roast types (light/medium) - of course having two batch brewers, which I think would still be cheaper than an espresso set up. 

Would love to hear some thoughts on this, especially from people who really know their coffee. Do you think people will stray away from coming if they know we don't serve espresso based drinks?

I have the 1Zpresso Q2 in my basket and I’m ready to trigger it but I wanted to ask for some opinions before doing it.

I read quite a few posts here about it and looks like is a safe choice in the lower end of the premium manual grinders.

I brew all the methods but espresso, mainly pour over V60, between 12 to 18 grams on average. Some times moka, rarely french press, I might buy an aeropress at some point.

For me it’s a “middle” expense, I don’t mind too much, I would like the JX but it’s 1.5 the price (50€ more) and I don’t think I’m ready for that yet. 

Will the Q2 last a long time?

I've tried to look around online and can't find many people discussing the Cona stove top models. I've seen a little discussion about Cory and Bodum models, but there don't seem to be any definitive answers. 

Some say it's fine to use directly on the hob, others say to buy a heat diffuser plate to ensure it heats the lower pot evenly, others say the pot will explode!

Has anyone encountered this, and how did you solve it? I thought it might be the thermistor, but that shouldn't be possible as the microprocessor/PID should never let the temp go that high. I opened the lid and there isn't any visible sign of damage. I can't read the markings on the thermistor (faded/smudged) so I can't look up the temp curve and test it.

After I was no longer satisfied with the Nespresso coffee, I decided to search for a piston machine with a grinder. Since I am just new into this world, I don't want to spend too much money at this moment. Therefore I have decided to go for the Sage the Bambino plus as a machine.

I decided to go for the Eureka Mignon Specialita as a grinder. At first I wanted to buy a Sage grinder(because it was cheaper), but I understand now that a Eureka grinder is considerably better. Since I didn't want to spend too much money, I searched for this grinder on marketplace(from the Netherlands). Yesterday I came across the following ad:

[https://www.marktplaats.nl/v/witgoed-en-apparatuur/koffiezetapparaten/m1838051972-eureka-mignon-specialita-bonenmaler-chroom](https://www.marktplaats.nl/v/witgoed-en-apparatuur/koffiezetapparaten/m1838051972-eureka-mignon-specialita-bonenmaler-chroom)

The person concerned sells the grinder for 350 euros and indicates that he has been using it for 6 months (he bought it at Koffiewarenhuis.nl). Yesterday I bid 330 euros and he accepted it immediately. I can pick up the grinder tomorrow. I was wondering, before I finally buy it, if this is a good buy? I don't know anything about grinders yet, so I find it difficult to pass judgment on this. Tomorrow I can inspect the grinder before buying it, but I wouldn't know where to look at either. What strikes me is that the sticker which says specialita looks strange. It looks like it is about to fall off or that it has just been glued on. On new devices, but even on older devices, the stickers look much nicer and neater. Or am I totally wrong?  


Thank you very much for your help,

Im kinda stuck. 
When i started out with Specialty Coffee - everything that came to my mind was espresso, cappuccino, long black and flat white. Which is why i got myself an Espresso Machine - the rest is history.
But I've really come to enjoy filter coffee in the last few months and that's where my problem starts!

Since Im currently using a DF64 as my dedicated espresso grinder (which i love btw) and noticing that it produces a lot of fines for the V60, which results in a muddier cup - I thought about buying a grinder solely for pour-over and especially V60!
My first choice would be something like a Fellow Ode with SSP MP Burrs - but that would be around 600€ here in Germany and that's kinda overkill, for my budget.

So my question(s) is/are: Do you think, that maybe something like a Commandante would suffice? Does it produce a better V60 Cup than a DF64? Or is a regular Fellow Ode V1.1 (even without SSP Burrs) ""better"" than a Commandante? For that matter, what actually is the Ode V1.1 Version and does it finally grind fine enough?

Im only drinking light roasts on pour over and love clean, sweet and juicy cups.

I have tried many beans including well known brands as well as locally roasted beans and there is always no pressure.

It makes a balanced cup with alot of mouth feel and body, with the ability to tailor the sweetness and acidity to your taste.

&amp;#x200B;

I use a coarser grind closer to French Press, and 20g to 300g water.

&amp;#x200B;

I started out with the Tetsu 4:6 method, meaning the first two pours are with the switch open, and equal to 120g water. 60g, 60g to have balanced sweetness and acidity; slightly less (50g) first pour and more second pour (70g) for a sweeter brew; and finally slightly more (70g) first pour and slightly less (50g) second pour for a slightly more acidic brew.

&amp;#x200B;

Next I would close the switch and fill the remaining 180g of water and stir quite quickly with the end of a chopstick in a clockwise for about 45sec to fully saturate all the grinds in the water like a french press, after 45sec I press the switch and continue stirring in clockwise direction. You can do longer than 45sec for stronger coffee, shorter for weaker coffee.

Will it make dialing in my espresso a lot harder if I'm constantly switching between super coarse and super fine between coffee types?

I drink three Nespresso coffee pods at the moment - espresso size. On the weekends, I occasionally do a V60 pourover with beans from a local cafe, for about 150-200 ml coffee ( I have them grind the beans for me at the moment).

Where I am:

- Nespresso pods are ~USD0.6 to USD0.8 a pod.
- A 200-225g of coffee beans is about USD9 to USD16 a bag.
- I am the only coffee drinker at home - so unsure whether I can use a bag of beans before they ""expire"".
- I am usually in a rush in the morning, so time efficiency is important during the week (I also keep a Nespresso machine at work for the afternoon pick me up).

I am interested in buying a beans grinder and making more espressos that way, learning more about coffee etc. However I am unsure whether it will just end up being a waste of money, given time cost / financial cost / coffee expiring before I finish it - and whether I am just thinking about this because I'm bored with Nespresso at the moment... 

Does anyone have any thoughts about the above, particularly whether it is cost and time efficient to make espresso at home (when compared to Nespresso), and if there are any good guides for how to do so?

Regular users can also post deals they come across. Come check out some of the roasters and other coffee-related businesses that Redditors work for!

Note that this thread will be weekly at least for the duration of the COVID-19 outbreak, since many roasters are running more specials than usual to drum up business.

We encourage everyone to post deals here especially since many roasters are holding specials to drive business affected by the COVID-19 outbreak. However, note that there will be zero tolerance for shady behavior. If you're found to be acting dishonestly here, your posting will be removed and we will consider banning you on the spot. If you yourself are affiliated with a business, please be transparent about it.

There are a few rules for businesses posting promotional material:

- You need to be active in /r/Coffee in a non-self-promotional context to participate in this thread. If it seems you are only here to promote your business in this thread, your submissions will be removed. Build up some /r/Coffee karma first. The Official Noob-Tastic Question Fest weekly thread, posted every Friday, would be a good place to start, and check out what is on the Front Page and jump in on some discussions. Please maintain a high ratio of general /r/Coffee participation to posts in this thread.

- If you are posting in this thread representing a business, please make sure to request your industry flair from the mods before posting.

- Don't just drop a link, say something worthwhile! Start a discussion! Say something about your roasting process or the exciting new batch of beans you linked to!

- Promotions in this thread must be actual deals/specials or new products. Please don't promote the same online store with the same products week after week; there should be something interesting going on. Having generally “good prices” does not constitute a deal.

- No crowdfunding campaigns (Kickstarter, Indiegogo, etc). Do not promote a business or product that does not exist yet. Do not bait people to ask about your campaign. Do not use this thread to survey /r/Coffee members or gauge interest in a business idea you have.

- Please do not promote affiliate/referral programs here, and do not post referral links in this thread.

- This thread is not a place for private parties to sell gear. /r/coffeeswap is the place for private party gear transactions.

- Top-level comments in this thread must be listings of deals. Please do not comment asking for deals in your area or the like.

- More rules may be added as needed. If you're not sure whether or not whatever you're posting is acceptable, message the mods and ask!

I started drinking coffee when I was 15. Fell in love instantly and have barely gone a day withouth ever since. 
I am now 19 years old and I drink at the very least 6 espressos a day.

I recently been wondering how my caffeine consumption might be affecting me. I guess there's only one way to figure it out!

I decided to switch to decaf for some time. The prior times I have gone without caffeine I was very much dysfunctional, foggy and hazy for multiple days. But this time I will document my experience.

It's been a while since I went without and I'm gonna give this a try for the next month. I'm only 19 years old and I feel like I should be able to function without.

I'm looking to buy a new  grinder, I don't have much of experience in that regard as I only owned an encore before, and I mainly drink espresso daily but maybe twice a week a v60 or a french press. 

Originally I intended on buying a niche zero as I think it is perfect for me with it's low retention, grind quality and the overall aesthetics. However shipping it to Germany where I live will cause a price overhead, I think it would cost around 700 to 750 euro (shipping, customs...etc) instead of the original price based on some forums and that makes me wonder is it still worth it at this price point.  
As an alternative I'm looking into these two possible scenarios:

1. A premium hand grinder for both styles like the Kinu m47 (but not sure which variant to get though) or 1Zpresso (I don't know why they have soo many variants and also don't know which to pick.) or maybe Helor 101...etc
2. An espresso focused electric grinder like the Sette 270 + something like the Knock Aergrind for pour over

I decided to stop using my nespresso machine, but I struggle to find what I want to buy. I'll work from home, and on most days I think I drink three coffees, like one lungo coffee in the morning, one capuccino after lunch and a macchiatto in the afternoon. I also drink some shorter espresssos sometimes, but actually I mostly take them in restaurants, or after a dinner with friends. I drink my coffee with some sugar and a bit of milk usually.

&amp;#x200B;

I've a very basic semi-automatic delonghi machine in my other house, where I enjoy drinking some good specialty coffee. My budget is about 800 to 1000$ ideally (I'm in switzerland, so it's roughtly the same in chf).

&amp;#x200B;

I feel that having access to two different beans would be a good solution, so I could have like a specialty coffee for the espressos and lungos, and another (probably cheaper) coffee for the capuccino's and machiatto's, where using very high end coffee on a daily basis would probably be a waste. But unfortunately it seems it's pretty rare to have that feature. From what I saw with this, I found:

\- Mostly the Melitta T Smart or TS, which are pretty similar. I think I found the TS for roughly the same price so would go for this. My issue with this is that as the coffee goes through the same grinder, there would be some leftovers, and if I alternate espresso and a capuccino from both bean selectors, I'll always have a mix of them. And if I need to make a ""empty coffee"" between each, I'll lose so much that it's not worth it, and lose much time

\- Siemens Eq.9 S 700. Looks perfect, but much more expensive. Found a good second hand one but it was sold when I asked again about it. And not sure I really want to spend 1k on a machine with no warranty...

Jura giga 6 , Delonghie maestosa are out of budget.

&amp;#x200B;

I could also simply lose that feature, and go for any good machine (delonghi primadonna or dynamica plus seem good, etc) that also take ground coffee and use that for the machiattos, but it looks a bit like a waste.

&amp;#x200B;

I think I want a fully automatic bean to cup machine to keep it easy. Is there really a big difference of quality with the semi-automatic ones?

My boyfriend and I love making cold brewed coffee at home. We have always preferred our coffee iced vs hot, especially in the summer. Making it ourselves saves a lot of money, which we need to be especially mindful of right now.

The recipe I use calls for a ratio of 8oz of coffee per 8 cups of water. When it is prepared, it is diluted with 1 cup of ice and 1/2 cup of water.

From what I’ve read, the cold brew concentrate can be stored up to two weeks. What I’m wondering is- does it have to be stored in its concentrated form? Will it lose any flavor if it is stored in its final diluted form?

I am struggling to be able to make a consistent and good coffee out of the machine i have, any suggestions would be appreciated!


Machine: Russell Hobbs Luna Filter Coffee Maker

I use the 1x4 brown Melitta filters as the basket that comes with the coffee maker is terrible for letting grounds through.

Coffee: Lavazza Rossa Grounds (I don't have a bean grinder)

I've been trying to play around with the 1:16 ratio, so for example the last cup i made was 240ml (about 8oz) and i used 16 grams of grounds and it seems almost bitter? Same result when using 14-16g coffee grounds, which were grounded recently and only opened 2 days ago.

The instructions on my machine advise that ""the reservoir is calibrated to give 12 large cups (at 125ml per cup), and for each large cup, add 6g of ground filter coffee..
I tried this and it was quite weak so i can't seem to find the middle ground..

Unrelated but the hotplate on the machine only stays on for 45 minutes at a time which really sucks having to remember to keep getting up to turn it back on!

For taste comparison I brewed the same coffee in an AeroPress and as pour-over to my liking. All good.

The machine's version was more acidic and lacked flavor. Temperature was already at its maximum setting, so I adjusted grind size to as fine as the machine could handle without stalling and obvious channeling. The result was more flavorful and had less pronounced acidity. While it was still far away from the AeroPress and pour-over, the taste was much improved. Definitely the right direction.

I wondered how much coffee the machine used. Maybe it used less and this caused the weakness. Again, for comparison I made an AeroPress with 60g/L (1:17 ratio). I measured both how much coffee I got out and weighed the completely dried puck.

On to the machine. I made a coffee (not ""espresso"") with its ""normal strength"" setting, measured the output, dried the puck (yes, I emptied the container before) and weighed the completely dried puck. I then calculated g/L, or the ratio, for both brews.

Result: The machine used about 2.5 times as much coffee. Roughly 150g/L or about a 1:7 ratio for ""coffee"".

* Is this normal or is the machine defective?
* Is the machine's design only capable to extract such a tiny fraction of the flavor compared to other brewing methods due to temperature, grind size, contact time, etc.?
* Any idea how I could have invalidated my little experiment?

1.  I love the coffee I am making with my Chemex. Am I correct in thinking that I won’t be disappointed with the Moccamaster? 

2. Can it produce a full 40 oz of coffee? 

3. How well does the thermal carafe insulate the coffee? Does it fully seal up like a travel mug, or is there always an opening? I ask because I usually brew coffee for myself and my partner in the morning, but she doesn’t usually drink hers until about 2-3 hours after it has been brewed.

We have a best-for-budget auto dripper at home, which uses paper filters. I'm not against it, since it's extremely easy to use. Otherwise, my sister probably wouldn't brew her coffee. And I also benefited from it for years. Especially for straining cold brew coffee...

But it's filtering the coffee too much. I guess those extremely fine grounds that only paper filter can strain gives a taste I prefer.

The machine also somehow has moods and it never brews the same coffee twice, I think, but that's a different story 🤣

Thanks to James Hoffman, I learned about cupping, after benefiting from his french press video. I don't usually test coffee, but after trying test comparison between a few cups, I noticed that the cups had actually drinkable coffee. There was a large sediment at the bottom, of course, but if I just drink the liquid layer, it was actually a normal and enjoyable coffee.

Recently, I started to brew only with this. It's extremely easy, almost as easy as instant coffee. And it tastes significantly better than the paper filter, for my taste. And no additional dishes to wash, unlike french press with a difficult to clean fine mesh.

I also liked to brew with Turkish coffee method before. It was similar, meaning no straining. But decanting(pouring very slowly) the coffee with the Turkish coffee pot(jazwa) gave unexpectedly clean cups. Even better than french press sometimes.

So I'm now mixing this with cupping. I have a glass tea brewing pot with a large bottom. So it's very suitable for decanting.

https://i.imgur.com/iCqrdHs.jpeg

I pour the coffee into the cup, after mixing it slowly at 4 mins. I don't want to disturb fine grounds that would settle later, so I let them settle in the cup, instead of the pot. They are not too much, so this doesn't concern me.

I sometimes use a coarse strainer during pouring, just to catch the floating coarse grounds and chaffs. But it's not necessary.

The cups are significantly cleaner than cupping alone. And even though I dirtied one additional dish, the glass pot is very easy to clean. I'm really enjoying this method now.

TL, DR: I like the things in the coffee that the paper filters strain. I also like simpler methods(thus, ""the best part is no part""). So I started brewing with cupping and it was what I was looking for. Then I started brewing in a large bottom tea pot (the image/link above) and slowly pouring into the cup, and this simple addition gave significantly cleaner cups, while still being simple. So I'm really enjoying this method above other methods.

Ps: I made an electric screwdriver adapter for my Porlex grinder 🤣 I don't know if it will heat the grounds too much, but it's being fine for one cup grinding.

Note that I made a lower quality adapter years ago but the tolerances were too bad and it didn't last long. So I used Torx head and tight tolerances this time, and it's going well. The screw bit was a bit rusty, so I did hot bluing and cooled it in leftover sunflower oil, that I was using for season coating pans. So it probably also has a thin polymer coating. I think it will be rust free now.

We've probably beaten to death the uselessness of these dates but I've noticed something new.  A roaster who used to put a BB date that was four months after the roast date is now specifying a date that is six months out.  I thought that was lame until I ordered some beans from another local roaster and they were labeled with a BB date that was 5.5 months out.

&amp;#x200B;

Recently, I had to work late at night. Basically, I had to do it for a couple of nights. I had no other options except to take some work home and finish all the reports at night after dinner when everyone was asleep. 

&amp;#x200B;

To be honest, I find working at nocturnal hours very satisfying -- you are on your own, no one bothers you, and you can focus on work without getting distracted by any other problems, text messages, and phone calls. You are just on your own with your thoughts and your work. Sometimes, I look in the window or go on the terrace at my house for a small break. Before that, I brew a delightful coffee. Recently, I've got a coffee press. I didn't want to wake everyone around with our noisy espresso machine. It also makes a good coffee, but the noise wakes everyone before the delightful scent reaches them.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I'm trying to master the skill of making a delightful coffee in a French press. I'm doing pretty well so far. I even noticed that coffee prepared in a French press is more aromatic than an espresso machine coffee. Maybe the technique plays a key role in the brewing process, or our espresso machine is a bit outdated. Who knows, but this aroma used to wake my family at night. Still, I try to be quiet and careful because I like to watch the starry sky and enjoy my drink.

&amp;#x200B;

But, this coin has another side. I struggle to fall asleep when I'm done with the work with all this caffeine. Then I struggle to wake up at night. Everything is twisted for me right now, and I feel lost when it is day and time to go to sleep. I know that the best solution is to consume less caffeine. I'm asking for some decaf sorts of coffee but with a pleasant taste and aroma.

I want to see if this is even possible for my situation to begin with.

I own a small coffee company in the Bay Area of California. We currently sell coffee bags but are looking to expand into a mobile cart. We would like to build a utility cart into a setup that sells ready to drink drip coffee and cold brew, accompanied with oat and almond milk in a Zojirushi pot, with extra plant-based milk in a cooler full of ice. We don't want to bring any dairy because of the risk of it spoiling and not having the necessary permits. Dairy is more of a liability than anything for our setup. 

As far as preparing the coffee goes, we would like to use commercial perculators to prepare large amounts of drip coffee that we will fill into a 5 gallon cambro. Cold brew would be prepared in a large Toddy cold brew bucket, and we would fill it into another 5 gallon cambro. Oat milk and almond milk would be setup ready to pour in a Zojirushi pot, and syrups, sugars, napkins, stirrers will be ready to go in case someone wants them. 

I know I need to obtain a seller's permit, health permit, and vehicle permit for my cart. My biggest question is can I get away with brewing the coffee in my own kitchen? People often use commercial kitchens when it comes to preparing food but coffee is something that can be so simply made your own house. 

Also, if I build my cart using a utility cart and simply sell ready to pour coffee, will I need a handwashing sink?

Have always drank filter coffee and trying a moka pot for the first time, but 30g of coffee and about 300ml of water are producing barely enough coffee for two people to share out of my 6-cup moka pot. It was a 'like new' unit from Amazon but seems literally spotless.

I'm following the guide produced by James Hoffman, so I'm following his process, stopping the brew at the first signs of sputtering:

.I'm filling the basket of My 6-cup moka pot with freshly ground coffee (not too fine) and topping it off without packing it down. 
.I'm filling the boiler with boiling water to just below the valve, assembling the pot and sticking it on a low-medium gas heat. 
.I'm watching the pot, and as it begins to produce a steady stream of coffee I turn the heat to low. 
.When it begins to sputter, I remove from heat and run the unit under cold water until sputtering stops.

The pot is way less than half filled with coffee at this point, and splitting it between two normal coffee mugs (from the UK for reference) produces what I'd describe as two puddles of coffee. With milk, it makes two half-mugs of strong, tasty coffee. When cleaning the unit, it seems like half the water is still in the boiler, and murky brown.

What is going wrong here? If this was a two pot machine I'd say happy days, but the idea of spreading this amount of coffee across six servings is... Well, it can't be possible, unless Italian coffee is traditionally served via Petrie dish. Am I some kind of cultureless moron serving out two triple strength coffees? Are Italian cups a lot smaller than I think they are?

Or am I doing something stupid that is causing the pot to spurt way earlier than it should? I inspect the grounds afterwards and there is no sign of channeling and all the grounds are moist. I checked the gasket too, it seems in good shape- the metal filter it is holding in place is loose enough to rotate but does not wobble.

I've tried the pot about eight times now trying not to vary my method, and have produced the same results every time so far.

&amp;#x200B;

I've got a filter coffee machine with which I have this issue: I fill the filter about half full and the water tank full, start brewing coffee, and soon the inflow of water to the filter is greater than what passes the filter, causing the water to overflow the filter and the ground coffee spills over to the cup holding the filter, and often the ground coffee spills over to the brewed coffee too. [Here's couple of pictures](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/hl1eg5mphldfolc/AABraX2o2c3MhzmOdkcXC-YRa?dl=0) of how it looks like afterwards.

The way I see it I either need to reduce the inflow of water, or increase the time water uses to pass the filter. The latter is likely the place to start. 

The flow of water through the filter is heavily redeced by the filter, to a - I believe - much greater extent than my previous filter coffee machines, so it seem like there's something about the design of the cup holding the filter causing the water to pass through very slowly.

**Review**

After researching the big bois like the Rancilio &amp; Gaggia Classic, gotta say it feels amazing not to spend that much money on those. PID and instant startup were the big features that got me not to buy those two. The moment people started talking about ""temperature surfing"" I was out, all I care about is a pretty nice cup of coffee with milk and a little sugar, iced or hot. 

Took like 9 failed batches with the Breville Smart Grinder but I finally got it dialed in. The espresso tastes great! I don't drink it straight, either Americano or Latte. I tried to take that plastic part of the portafilter off but I just couldn't, but the coffee tastes fine and no weird plastic taste. I was thinking of getting those expensive tamp/distributors, but honestly that cheap-ass plastic tamp that comes with it works just fine. 

The steam wand is loud AF, sounds like hellspawn being fried alive by the sun and screaming for mercy. I can't tell if it's just my bad technique or I'll have to deal with that every time I froth milk, but it seriously hurts my ears. My dog hates it lol. 

Honestly from a convenience standpoint, this thing is amazing and I don't see myself upgrading for years. The fact that I can roll out of bed and make an espresso within the next 5 mins is insane. I know r/espresso probably hates me but to those who are stressing out over your next machine or grinder, looking at the $400-800+ minimums for each that redditors claim you have to spend, this $300 machine has me perfectly satisfied as someone who just likes 'good' coffee and doesn't need 'best in class' at home. The mental stress I didn't know I had about having to get the super expensive 'entry-level' gear is all gone and it feels wonderful.

(Tldr : do you know a way to remove rust on burrs without making them less sharp or bringing bad taste to the coffee grinded? And do you have any ideas about oils I could use to varnish the wood that doesn't go rancid or have a taste? Linseed oil seems applicable because it doesn't go rancid but is bitter so idk what to use.)


I recently acquired an antique Peugeot coffee grinder at a flea market. It is in quite good condition for the price (20€) so I wanted to try to restore it. 

There is rust on the handle that I removed by sanding but I don't know how to properly clean the burrs. As there is some rust around the burrs but not on the parts that actually grind the beans, I was tempted to soak it in vinegar and salt (to remove rust according to some web articles). However I also read that putting any liquid on the burrs would decrease their efficiency and was generally bad. Any suggestions? 

My other issue is dealing with the wood. It's quite old but in good condition, though coffee has been sitting there for a long time. That's why I wanted to try to sand it a bit with fine grit and then varnish it with something. The issue is that either the products are not food safe, either it can be done using oils that get rancid over time or that bring a bad taste. I thought of using linseed oil but it seems to be bitter at taste so idk if this will have any consequences on the end cup. 

It's my first time posting there so I hope I'm doing things the right way ^^

Do you have a question about how to use a specific piece of gear or what gear you should be buying? Want to know how much coffee you should use or how you should grind it? Not sure about how much water you should use or how hot it should be? Wondering about your coffee's shelf life?

Don't forget to use the resources in our [wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/wiki)! We have some great starter guides on our [wiki ""Guides"" page](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/wiki/guides) and [here is the wiki ""Gear By Price"" page](http://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/wiki/gear#wiki_coffee_gear_suggestions) if you'd like to see coffee gear that [/r/Coffee](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee) members recommend.

Regular users can also post deals they come across. Come check out some of the roasters and other coffee-related businesses that Redditors work for!

Note that this thread will be weekly at least for the duration of the COVID-19 outbreak, since many roasters are running more specials than usual to drum up business.

We encourage everyone to post deals here especially since many roasters are holding specials to drive business affected by the COVID-19 outbreak. However, note that there will be zero tolerance for shady behavior. If you're found to be acting dishonestly here, your posting will be removed and we will consider banning you on the spot. If you yourself are affiliated with a business, please be transparent about it.

There are a few rules for businesses posting promotional material:

- You need to be active in /r/Coffee in a non-self-promotional context to participate in this thread. If it seems you are only here to promote your business in this thread, your submissions will be removed. Build up some /r/Coffee karma first. The Official Noob-Tastic Question Fest weekly thread, posted every Friday, would be a good place to start, and check out what is on the Front Page and jump in on some discussions. Please maintain a high ratio of general /r/Coffee participation to posts in this thread.

- If you are posting in this thread representing a business, please make sure to request your industry flair from the mods before posting.

- Don't just drop a link, say something worthwhile! Start a discussion! Say something about your roasting process or the exciting new batch of beans you linked to!

- Promotions in this thread must be actual deals/specials or new products. Please don't promote the same online store with the same products week after week; there should be something interesting going on. Having generally “good prices” does not constitute a deal.

- No crowdfunding campaigns (Kickstarter, Indiegogo, etc). Do not promote a business or product that does not exist yet. Do not bait people to ask about your campaign. Do not use this thread to survey /r/Coffee members or gauge interest in a business idea you have.

- Please do not promote affiliate/referral programs here, and do not post referral links in this thread.

- This thread is not a place for private parties to sell gear. /r/coffeeswap is the place for private party gear transactions.

- Top-level comments in this thread must be listings of deals. Please do not comment asking for deals in your area or the like.

- More rules may be added as needed. If you're not sure whether or not whatever you're posting is acceptable, message the mods and ask!

# Example 1:
So if my room temperature is 12 degrees and I want to get water at 70 degrees, I'll use a factor of 0.66. That means to get 1L of water at 70 degrees, I'll boil 0.66L of water and mix it with 0.34L of water at room temperature.

# Example 2:
If I need 500g of water at 85 degrees and my room temperature is 22 degrees, I'll need 0.81*500g ~ 400g of boiling water and 100g of water at room temperature.

If you'd like an exact formula, it is the following:

```
mass_of_boiling_water = (final_temperature - room_temperature)/(100 - room temperature) x total_mass

I bought some Lavazza espresso grind -- too coarse. Pissed out about 1 cup of coffee in &lt;20 sec.

Next, I bought some Illy espresso grind. I'm able to get closer but the yield is still between 50ml - 100ml for 15g in the double basket (brewing at 195 - 202 degrees).

So, I went to the local roaster who gave me 4 different grinds to try (for free, thank you, kind roaster). 3 were non-starters: way too coarse or way too fine. One option pulled ~40ml for 15g in the double basket. It tasted OK, not perfect. This is still too fine, right? Too much yield. I tamped the crap out of it.

I'm a bit type A, so I have a spreadsheet tracking the input, pre-infusion time, brew time, yield, result. I have not pulled one great shot yet.

Here's my deal. I know nothing about specialty coffee except that I do love espresso and mainly want to make my own mochas without going out to coffee shops. It's just me at home so I don't need anything really fancy. I am looking at the Nespresso machines because I'm hearing that they create the best flavor. I have a budget of about $140 for a machine &amp; an additional $30-40 for a protection plan. My questions about choosing a machine:

1. Is my budget too low? I am looking at going through Amazon (which I know some people hate) because I have Prime and always get good customer service with them in case of problems.
2. What is the ""original"" machine(s)? I was told the pods are the best and cheapest. I don't know if I can make mochas with this one though. I'd like to make mochas most of all.
3. Is Nespresso the best choice for me? I'd like the convenience of pods but being able to also use my own coffee would be more budget-friendly.
4. I have looked at other machines but don't know if they are worth it. What about machines like the Chef Wave and other espresso makers?
5. Are there universal/reusable pods for the Nespresso or the other ""good"" machines?
6. I'm looking at making 1 mocha a day (occasionally 2). I expect to spend about $35 for coffee pods (if I can't use my own grounds).
7. I have a milk frother already.

So, basically, I want a machine that makes good coffee without it being a complicated process. I want something very simple to use and not too hard on the wallet for buying the coffee.

During this time, which began when I was 27, I started with mochas...I enjoyed the dark chocolate flavor and how it mixed with the bitter espresso.   Like many of us, I eventually graduated to Americanos (they're cheaper), then black coffee, then straight espresso shots.   The work environment was extremely stressful, fast-paced, and busy, and we usually earned about $15k-$18k/wk at our peak with a skeleton crew of never more than 6 baristas, total, on the schedule (including the lead).   If we had to work 6 days a week to keep it open, that was just tough. 

During this time, I realized as I got older, I couldn't keep up with the pace.   So I did what we all do, got my Xanax prescription increased, and started pounding more and more shots so I could keep up.   My boss was not understanding of anything less than excellence, and I was convinced she deserved it.   It was unacceptable and *weak* to not be 100% ""on"" in the workplace.   My doctor started to advise me that my anxiety, heart rate, and bowel movements were all being negatively impacted, but I brushed it off.   This was *caffeine"" we're talking about...its not a serious drug.

About 5 years in, I developed interstitial cystitis.   It took me 2 years to get a diagnosis.    Caffeine is a horrible trigger for this condition, but I gave up orange juice and other trigger foods and decided I'd double down on coffee.   I can't do my job if I don't drink coffee after all.    And it was *unprofessional* not to be a coffee drinker and work at Starbucks.   

After about 8 or 9 years, my anxiety began to seriously increase in intensity.   Angry outbursts happened with customers, co-workers, anyone who I could lash out at, because my resting heart rate was now well above 100.   But I'd done this so long, I don't know how to do any other job.   Starbucks is the way.   So I just decided ""no cold brew,"" and kept on.

11 years in, I was hospitalized.   The ER doctor said I had ""caffeine intoxication.""   ""A toxic amount of caffeine is in your blood.    Have you been consuming more than 250mg a day?""   I laughed.   ""It's *easily* upwards of 500.""   He grimaced, but I laughed it off.   I'd just taper it down, do half-caff.   I wasn't addicted I could quit whenever I want.   Meanwhile, I developed nasty case of IBS.

At year 12, I had a mental breakdown.   Starbucks consumed my every waking thought, and I knew if I left leadership there it would soon fall apart.   But I finally got the courage to tell my boss I couldn't handle the pressure anymore.   It was my anxiety, you see.  My coffee intake continued.    A year later, I asked for a transfer out of Starbucks.   Now, I'll quit, I said.

I didn't for at least 2 years.   I developed nasty acid reflux, which I'm medicated for morning and night.

It's now 5 days ago.   I didn't have a bowel movement for over 48 hours.     The doctor said ""you have done significant damage over time to your bowel system with your coffee intake, and if you don't quit caffeine, it won't get better.""   He prescribed me several fine products that I'm now using, and I made the decision there:   the only way for me to break the addiction to coffee...was to go cold turkey.

I realised (about 15 seconds in) that I had forgot to empty out the ""filter rinse water"", so I quickly took out the filter (with the coffee in it) and poured out the old water. I then brewed it as normal (the James Hoffman pour over method).

The coffee turned out incredible, not bitter at all.  Is there some way to replicate this by adjusting some other variable, or would it be better to just ""throw out the bloom"" to achieve the same results?

I’ve been using the Gaggia Classic Pro for some time and I am now ready to invest in a more professional espresso machine for my new appartment. Ideally, I would like to keep this new machine for many years and in some near future also plumb it directly to a water source. This is why I’m looking at purchasing an espresso machine with a rotary pump. The design of this machine is very important to me as I want it to be the piece of resistance of my apartment. After conducting my research, I’ve narrowed down my options to 4 machines, two Rocket and two ECM models (one HX and one dual boiler per brand), which all seem to perform great. Unfortunately, I’m still hesitating between the models below and I can find a proper recommendation online. I’m not sure if I should invest the extra money and get a dual boiler machine or if one brand is generally better than the other.

These are the models I’m currently looking at:
- Rocket Mozzafiato Evo R (~1,840 USD)
- Rocket Cinquantotto (~2,333 USD)
- ECM Technika V PID (~2,287 USD)
- ECM Synchronika (~2,687 USD)

I prefer to stick the same coffee beans and will probably not experiment as much as others with frequently changing beans. I drink about two coffees a day, usually a latte in the morning and an espresso after lunch. I also like to invite my family and neighbors to a cup of coffee every now and then. So I don’t expect to make more than 4 coffee drinks per day.

Which model would you choose? Would you go against one of these and if so why? Dual boiler or HX for a home setup? Rocket or ECM?

Thanks a ton!

Anyway, we have some local sweet sales on Philips and Siemens super-automatic machines. I am looking at those usually costing $600-900.

I am also looking at them to get some more fancy milky stuff out of it. Anyway, here's what the cleaning of my current one includes:

\- cleaning the nozzle of frother is fine, it takes me just a couple of seconds  
\- the tray for the ground coffee waste is more annoying, but because it is not just about throwing it out, but about a mold already forming in it, so each time it requires a full clean with a dish soap etc.\`; draining the water tray is fine, at least there isn't any mold there  
\- whether a weekly or monthly interior cleaning (including the brewing unit) is a nightmare, I open the compartment door and there is coffee and mold everywhere - my favorite part are all the crevices with a stuck moldy coffee - cleaning this is about 30-60 minutes ceremony and four stages of cleaning (wet wipe, dish soap clean, dry wipe, rubbing alcohol cleaning of the stubborn stuck coffee/mold).

I recently started doing my research on getting my first espresso machine, but where I live, its kinda hard to find good prices for espresso machines. One or max 2 stores offer it, so it makes doing ""smart"" decisions lot harder. But then I stumbled upon this store ""Caffe Italia"". And they seemed to have great deal on the same machine I was looking to get, Gaggia Classic Pro. 

Quick browse around the internet, lead me to believe they might ship a machine atleast, if I paid with my credit card, the risk would be relatively low. I would just let my credit card company handle the plausible issues, and I would mod the gaggia anyways, so bad warranty was kinda expected. But while doing the order, I mistyped my card info, which resulted in order failing (transaction didn't go through) but order still processed? Idk what happened, its kinda buggy. But I left the customer support a message, on what happened.

It took them few days to respond, but they still did. In their email they just stated that ""just order it again"", and thats about it. The thing is, they responded 5 hours after their ""opening hours"", yeah, its probably out sourced, as everything is. But kinda shady in my opinion. Hard to imagine their support staff is working 10pm on a friday night, support hours listed on site is 10-16. Language was also pretty bad, probably worse than google translated, so probably 2 rounds of google translate? 

Then I went around and started looking around trust pilots. I don't know how I missed it on my initial sweep, but atleast entire finnish trustpilot site is botted, with obvious grammar mistakes on every review. Also almost like they are arguing the bad ones. 

Entire reason I'm typing this out now, is so people can find a post stating that this site is pretty shady. Everything on the internet seems to be just spammed with positive stuff, to hide the bad and honest stuff.

Search term ""Caffe Italia Reddit"", etc obvious experience thread tags are covered in non related posts. Can't prove they are trying to hide it, but wouldn't be out of ordinary for them it seems like... They also list their HQ to be in Finland/what ever portal of their site you look at. All just trying to make it seem more legit.

Also, if I'm wrong about them, on my initial impressions, you are free to prove me wrong. Share your expriences here, and I'll gladly delete this post.

What I’m not sure about is if I want to extract more
From the beans, should I let the crust stay longer? Or break the crust sooner and let the coffee settle at the bottom? Does more coffee extract from the crust, or from settled coffee?

I tried to boil just 750ml of water in it and the lid popped off and the kettle boiled over before it even got to a rolling boil. So the 1L capacity, while technically accurate, is kind of useless when the kettle is actually used for its express purpose of boiling water.

Hario makes a 1.2L version but based on my experience with the 1L version, I'm not confident that the extra 20% capacity will prevent boil-over, and most other manufacturers of nice stainless kettles make versions right around 1L capacity.

Do you have a question about how to use a specific piece of gear or what gear you should be buying? Want to know how much coffee you should use or how you should grind it? Not sure about how much water you should use or how hot it should be? Wondering about your coffee's shelf life?

Don't forget to use the resources in our [wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/wiki)! We have some great starter guides on our [wiki ""Guides"" page](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/wiki/guides) and [here is the wiki ""Gear By Price"" page](http://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/wiki/gear#wiki_coffee_gear_suggestions) if you'd like to see coffee gear that [/r/Coffee](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee) members recommend.

Here's what I've come up with. 

Imagine a graph with X and Y axis, and in the middle is the theoretical perfect cup. (Not objective, but according to your taste.) One axis would represent strength, and the other, extraction. A coffee that tasted strong, but too acidic or salty might be a high strength, low extraction brew. One that tasted weak and a little subdued or flat would be low strength, high extraction. All you would have to do is draw your graph axis and make a mark for how you thought the coffee tasted. The closer to your ideal balance, the better. 

It was inspired partly by some recent Ārāmse videos about coffee logging and their coffee recipe builder system, and also by a plugin I use in my recording software that uses two axis (axes?) to balance EQ. (I've linked a screencap.) 

What do you think? Would this be useful as part of your coffee log?

Honduran-native Mayra Orellana-Powell founded Catracha Coffee Company to link farmers in her home community of Santa Elena to specialty buyers. Over the course of a decade, it has helped an ever-expanding community of farmers to produce great coffee and gain economic security. With each year, Catracha’s coffee also seems to improve, becoming more expressive. Just take this deeply satisfying single origin: sweet like brown sugar or raw honey, it marries cocoa flavors with a stone fruit-like brightness, calling to mind the pure bliss of chocolate-covered cherries.

Drinking it is only the second best  part of the experience, and the crazy equipment/technique black hole keeps pulling me in. However, while I'd love to own a big-boy espresso machine and go nuts every morning making cortados and flat whites for my family while shouting about grind size and extraction rates at my neighbours, I am currently relying on a moka pot to get me as close to a tasty espresso type drink at home as I can without dropping major $$$.   

I've followed Hoffman's moka technique and I can get a consistently delicious strong brew, but without a proper steam wand, I am largely limited to an Aerolatte hand frother, which is actually pretty good at getting a decent microfoam in heated full-fat milk. Not perfect, since it requires a few iterations of froth/shake down stir/froth some more so that the few larger bubbles pop and the milk gets a bit more uniform, but the final result is totally acceptable.

One thing I've experimented with (and I was wondering if anyone has thoughts on) is adding evaporated milk in a 1:3 ratio to full fat milk before heating and frothing in order to get some more velvety thickness in the milk foam, along with a sweeter and richer taste. I'm guessing that the evaporation and heating process involved with evaporated milk does something chemically to the milk proteins that is similar to the effect steam has on the flavour of regular milk, but I honestly don't know what, other than that it's a definite improvement over just plain milk.

For reference, I'm looking for things around the price of:

* $115 USD
* $145 CAD
* €108 EURO (before VAT)
* £90 (before tax)

I'm leaning towards the [Timemore Chestnut C2](https://www.amazon.com.au/TIMEMORE-chestnut-electricity-Portable-positioning/dp/B0833SDN8M/) which can be found for roughly $100 NZD, which seems much less expensive than other grinders of similar quality. This looks like the best deal around; even the [Porlex Mini II](https://www.amazon.com.au/Porlex-Mini-II-Coffee-Grinder/dp/B082L26FLX) costs more. A simple upgrade to the [Timemore Chestnut G1](https://www.amazon.com.au/TIMEMORE-Chestnut-Stainless-Adjustable-Positioning/dp/B08TX43SSF/) triples the price to $300 NZD, so I won't bother with that.

Looking at other brands, the [1Zpresso Q2](https://www.amazon.com.au/1Zpresso-AeroPress-Stainless-Numerical-Adjustable/dp/B083TGGHGL/) seems to cost at least $230 NZD; more than twice as much as the C2. The Comandante C40 comes in at $500 or [$400 on sale](https://www.espressoninja.co.nz/product/comandante-c40-mk3-hand-grinder-black/), which is sadly way out of my budget. 

Looking at some other brands: the [Hero manual grinder](https://www.amazon.com.au/Manual-Coffee-Grinder-Stainless-Conical/dp/B08X39ZJMB/) comes in at a reasonable $120 NZD and the [Normcore](https://www.amazon.com.au/Manual-Coffee-Grinder-Adjustable-Stainless/dp/B089P1MNW5/) comes in at $145. This one from Varia comes in at [$230](https://www.espressoninja.co.nz/product/varia-hand-grinder/). These funky grinders by Jaffee (?) comes in at [$230](https://www.coffeelovers.co.nz/products/improved-version-portable-coffee-mill-manual-coffee-grinder-stainless-steel-burr-hidden-handle?_pos=4&amp;_sid=4f23b783d&amp;_ss=r) and [$340](https://www.coffeelovers.co.nz/collections/manual-coffee-grinders/products/manual-coffee-grinder-portable-coffee-mill-stainless-steel-core-hand-manual-handmade-coffee-bean?variant=29033343844426) respectively. This [random one](https://dipacci.co.nz/collections/hand-grinders/products/precision-hand-grinder?variant=40547356180651) comes in at $110. Peugeot (the French car company) makes [a beautiful one](https://www.thecoffeecompany.co.nz/product/peugeot-kronos-coffee-grinder) for $200.

And that's basically everything I've been able to find. Any suggestions of models I've missed? What do you think my best option is? I can afford to go over the price of the Timemore Chestnut C2 but given the competition I don't know if there's a point.

Could it be that the heat is too high when I am making the coffee? Because the moka pot is brand new it needs to run through a few cycles? I have watched several videos and read several forums but can’t  quite place my finger on it.

Like many, I used to douse my coffee with milk and sugar. I drank the whole menu at Starbucks and couldn't imagine drinking something black. Instead, I needed it milky like the sun and would impress my barista friends at the number of pumps of sugar I used. I used to be the person that would put a quarter of drizzle in my Starbucks Caramel Macchiato. 

Now, being 28 years old, I don't drink coffee everyday, but when I do, I drink it black. It's taken me a long time to enjoy coffee this way, and I think anyone can learn to drink it black as well. It just takes small incremental changes, and a desire to change.

Where I started: I used to be the kid that put 10 pumps of classic, or sugar in my cup. Any drink, you name it. I needed a quarter-cup of cream, and at least 3-4 packets of sugar, Splenda, Equal etc. I couldn't imagine why anyone would want hot bean water. I saw coffee as a drink to energize. At the time, I was working at Starbucks, so I had the sugar and milk and cream to my disposal.

I eventually got a job in a third-wave coffee shop and anyone that knows coffee, now knows Starbucks is a terrible cup of coffee. It's good for a pinch and social status, for carrying that white-green mermaid cup, but if you want good coffee, you go to a third-wave coffeeshop and café. I'm talking about Irving Farm, Blue Bottle, Hungry Ghost, etc. 

Sugar is by far the easiest thing to let go. Just reduce your intake by a quarter. You'll hardly notice and especially if you're pairing your cup of coffee to a pastry or meal, you definitely won't miss it. 

Cream just does magical things to coffee. It makes it turn milky-white, and silky-smooth on your tongue. And that's exactly why you need to remove it. Around this time, I started to drink black tea black, without milk or sugar. I got stuck on the cream, no-sugar phase for a while. 

I recently started to take a sip of my coffee before I would drop in cream. Like an ode to coffee, or a tribute, I would taste the first sip black, before I added cream. Stuck on this phase for a while. 

Eventually, I just got lazy. I would still take that first sip. Sometimes I would add cream. Other times, I'd get too busy and forget I had the coffee, but I would chug it down. Happened too many times to me.

Then one day, I just started to drink it black. I didn't enjoy it, but I would make a face after every sip. Like drinking a shot of alcohol, I would purge and gawk. 

If you ever drink coffee black, you know it's most bitter at it's highest temperature. So one day, I started to experiment. I'd let it cool to warm or room-temperature. That did the trick.

Today, I'm cream-free, sugar-free and loving it. Coffee is a ritual and part of my day, but I enjoy it black. I didn't think I could ever get here, from 10-pumps of sugar, to cream no-sugar, to now, black.

This was 3-years in the making. I'm now free.

I have gotten back into coffee drinking, and also home roasting (right now Poppery with coffee from Sweet Maria's, though may get a Fresh Roast), and primarily use an old Zassenhaus to grind and use in an Aeropress with paper filter (use Hoffman's recipe). Also own a french press, and a couple of Bialettis (small and large size) that I almost never use. I drink about 1-2 cups max a day, average bit less than 1 as don't drink coffee every day. 

I just bought a Timemore C2 Max (may also get an 1zpresso) for a better (or at least faster grinder) and looking forward to using it. 

Thinking would be nice to try either the Clever or Hario Switch (Clever seems a bit cheaper and plastic for better heat retention) to change it up with the Aeropress.  Is Amazon the main place to buy the Clever (seems like walmart also has it but not sure its genuine, as sellers aren't walmart per se).? 

Any thoughts on if this is a good progression or other suggestions?

I don't typically have a taste for bitter things, but I've only recently found myself access to what I assume is *good* coffee. So I need help making this work for me.

My work place has an espresso machine. This is where I get my coffee. You select an option on the screen, it grinds the coffee and pours it. Options for chocolate, and what I can only assume is coffee creamer.

I've been gaining weight and can't figure out why when my diet has been stable. I realized this selection I'm using must be coffee creamer (I didn't know what it was before a few weeks ago). And I've been basically drinking 1 4oz shot + 10oz coffee creamer once or twice a day for 4 days a week for months. Normally I take it easy on the sugar, like a lot. (I think that's why it hooked me so fast.)

What can I do to make a nice 14 to 16oz coffee? I can use stevia to sweeten, but once I take the creamer out of the equation, I only have the shots (and hot chocolate). Work has little non dairy creamer packs, but I'm trying to eliminate those calories.

My wife and I have a nespresso vertuo at home, which was really more of something my wife was using, but toward the beginning of the pandemic, I started drinking more coffee from the nespresso (mostly because it was really easy to order the pods, while getting anything else at the time was more difficult.)

One of the things I like about tea is the absolutely massive number of tea choices you can explore, as well as a lot of the ritual that can be involved in brewing a nice cup of tea.  The nespresso doesn't really offer that, so I started looking further into what's out there for coffee.

I started out with a V60 and a Krups electric burr grinder.  My wife had bought a french press in the past, and I also ended up buying an aeropress.

With the french press and aeropress I've been able to make pretty decent coffee, and sometimes can make a good cup of coffee with the V60, but it kind of seems hit or miss, sometimes ending up a bit sour or bitter, or both.  

I also keep getting this ""paper"" flavor.  At first I thought it was coming from the paper filters I'm using, but then I realized I was tasting it when I wasn't using a filter as well.

I just bought a 1zpresso jx pro (I spent a bunch of time debating between the various timemore and 1zpresso grinders, and eventually decided to go with this one,) which, to be fair, is 3x the cost of the krups, but the grind is so much more consistent.  

I honestly wasn't expecting there to be that big of a difference in the flavor, but my pour overs have just been really nice using the new grinder.  No sourness, just ever so slightly on the edge of becoming bitter, which I'm assuming if I dialed up one more click would go away, none of the ""paper"" flavor I was getting with the Krups.  The flavor of the coffee seems more rounded (not sure how to better describe it.) And the coffee actually seems to have a bit more body as well, it's a really nice mouthfeel.

The water is also running through the coffee much slower, which I was worried about at first, thinking I was going to end up over-extracting the coffee, but it really wasn't.

The biggest problem I'm having with the new grinder is that it takes almost a minute of manually turning the crank to get enough grounds for the pour over, which I guess I'll get used to.",True,False,False,Coffee,t5_2qhze,975852,public,self,"Was using a cheap electric grinder, bought a slightly more expensive hand grinder, and damnit, the coffee from the hand grinder is actually better...",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/u7x4ng/was_using_a_cheap_electric_grinder_bought_a/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Welcome to the daily [/r/Coffee](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee) question thread!

Do you have a question about how to use a specific piece of gear or what gear you should be buying? Want to know how much coffee you should use or how you should grind it? Not sure about how much water you should use or how hot it should be? Wondering about your coffee's shelf life?

Don't forget to use the resources in our [wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/wiki)! We have some great starter guides on our [wiki ""Guides"" page](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/wiki/guides) and [here is the wiki ""Gear By Price"" page](http://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/wiki/gear#wiki_coffee_gear_suggestions) if you'd like to see coffee gear that [/r/Coffee](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee) members recommend.

I've been really enjoying using the Clever Dripper recently due to its ease of use. I tend to get more interesting cups with my Aeropress or V60 though, so I think I need to work on my recipe/extraction.
I pretty much do what James Hoffmann recommends in his video. So: Water -&gt; Coffee -&gt; stir to wet all the grounds -&gt; 2mins -&gt; stir/shake to break the crust -&gt; 30sec -&gt; draw down.

To change the end result I can think of the following variables: ratio, water temperature, grind, steep time, agitation. 

I'm pretty happy with the strength of the coffee I get. I usually go for something like 65-70g per liter of water. 

As I use mostly light roasts I tend to brew with boiling water (or close to boiling, as there's some temperature loss due to starting with the water). With more medium roasts I drop it a couple of degrees. Steep time seems to only barely increase extraction in immersion or steep and release brews.
So what's left is grind and agitation. From what I can vaguely remember, with immersion brews, agitation has more significant of an effect than a finer/coarser grind. Because there's a percolation phase though, I would assume that the grind is more significant than in a French Press for example.

Of course I'm constantly trying out stuff myself, but I'd be interested to know what your experiences have been and how you've successfully adjusted the extraction with the Clever.",True,False,False,Coffee,t5_2qhze,975113,public,self,How do you guys dial in your Clever Dripper brews?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/u7ajyt/how_do_you_guys_dial_in_your_clever_dripper_brews/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After this event, i now feel like i perceive the caffeine a lot stronger. I always felt it being strong, but i was able to drink a cup of coffee and not feel this bad. Although maybe I feel like the caffeine is stronger now because in my opinion, the effect that nicotine had on me was quite similar to caffeine to me.

Today was that day, 18g in, distributed, tamped, added paper filters above and below the coffee bed, inserted into my machine, pressed go and realized that I was a bit too thin, it took a WHILE to get everything out (should be programmed to pull 50g of liquid).

Since I was getting some sour espressos before (since I upped my dose from 16g to 18g) I was okay with it since it looked pretty uniform. After 35~50 seconds it finished, I decided to taste it, since the smell was clean, I didn't feel that ""sour"" smell.

I swirled with a tiny spool I have and tasted all the crema that remained at the spool and HOLY. FUCKING. SHIT. it tasted fucking amazing, almost no bitterness, nice finish, and a super strong caramel/nuts flavor.

Second spoon was almost the same thing, and after that it all went downhill, turning bitter and bitter by the second.

Note that this thread will be weekly at least for the duration of the COVID-19 outbreak, since many roasters are running more specials than usual to drum up business.

We encourage everyone to post deals here especially since many roasters are holding specials to drive business affected by the COVID-19 outbreak.

- You need to be active in /r/Coffee in a non-self-promotional context to participate in this thread. If it seems you are only here to promote your business in this thread, your submissions will be removed. Build up some /r/Coffee karma first.

- If you are posting in this thread representing a business, please make sure to request your industry flair from the mods before posting.

- Don't just drop a link, say something worthwhile! Start a discussion! Say something about your roasting process or the exciting new batch of beans you linked to!

- Promotions in this thread must be actual deals/specials or new products. Please don't promote the same online store with the same products week after week; there should be something interesting going on. Having generally “good prices” does not constitute a deal.

- No crowdfunding campaigns (Kickstarter, Indiegogo, etc). Do not promote a business or product that does not exist yet. Do not bait people to ask about your campaign. Do not use this thread to survey /r/Coffee members or gauge interest in a business idea you have.

- Please do not promote affiliate/referral programs here, and do not post referral links in this thread.

- This thread is not a place for private parties to sell gear. /r/coffeeswap is the place for private party gear transactions.

I love learning more about things on the side so I thought, *I wonder if there's a course I could do that goes really deep on this stuff?* 

And naturally after some research I found the Q Grader Certification. But that's for really serious professionals, with a high cost and high barrier to entry. I don't want to go that far. But I'm inspired by the breadth of knowledge that's necessary to be certified. I'd love to get maybe half way there purely for fun as a hobbyist, without too much monetary pain or having to take exams. I also don't think the Q Grader course goes too much into different brewing methods (that's not the point) but for the home enthusiast I'd want to focus there too.

So with one eye on this [useful course summary I found](https://www.coffeestrategies.com/q-grader/q-grader-course/), and tweaking substantially for my interests, here's my proposed at-home syllabus:

**General coffee knowledge**
* Read a well-regarded book about each of: cultivation / harvesting, processing, cupping, roasting and brewing.
* Solid understanding of the impact of bean origin.
* Solid understanding of the coffee supply chain and cost / pricing mechanisms (I'm an econ nerd), including both commodity grade and specialty coffee.
* Put James Hoffmann's *The World Atlas of Coffee* on my bookshelf so people know I mean business.

**Roasting**
* Buy a roaster, burn a bunch of beans, then stop burning them and actually start roasting well.
* Solid understanding of and ability to identify roasting defects.
* Ability to roast various origins and varietals to the correct roast levels. 

**Cupping / Tasting**
* Comprehensive understanding of the various cupping protocols.
* Solid understanding of the impact on water on cupping, and the ability to identify where water is causing issues.
* Ability to identify different intensities of sweet, salty and sour solutions (inspiration from [here](https://www.coffeestrategies.com/q-grader/sensory-skills-exam/))
* Familiarity with the Le Nuz Du Cafe scents (or equivalent).
* Comfortable in scoring a coffee using the SCAA Coffee Cupping Form (acknowledging the subjectivity in this, and fact you'd never get close to professional level)

**Brewing** 
* Comprehensive understanding of making espresso, e.g. the impact of grind, ratio, distribution, temperature, pre-infusion, flow rate, pressure, dialing in, diagnosing poor technique.
* Solid understanding of two other brew methods (for me, Aeropress and v60). Able to experiment with different techniques and identify differences which result.

*Note: nothing in the above addresses green coffee grading - doesn't seem relevant enough for me as a home hobbyist.

This is my first post on this sub. After a year and a half of drinking Nespresso, I decided I wanted to try the Bialetti Moka Express. I had a few questions about this.

First, the directions mention using cold/room temperature water. But I've also read elsewhere that I should use hot water, because it cuts down on the brewing time, &amp; it prevents the coffee from tasting metallic. Is this true?

Second, what do you recommend the heat setting/length of time? When will I know when to turn it off and when the coffee is ready?

Third, should I use a cold towel/put the moka pot under cold running water to cool it after?

Fourth, I read on another website the following:

""Does The Moka Pot Make Espresso?

I know that moka pots are often referred to as “stovetop espresso makers”, but sadly, that description is a little... optimistic.

You see, espresso is made when hot water is forced through super fine coffee grounds at 8-10 bars of pressure. The moka pot is only capable of producing 1-2 bars.

It’s just not enough to really be called true espresso, though the result is definitely espresso-like.

The coffee is still intense, still heavy-bodied, and still good for making faux-espresso drinks like cappuccinos and americanos. But if you want to be able to make true espresso, you’ll need an actual espresso machine.""

For almost three years now I've been using a refurbished Cuisinart DBM-8 Supreme Grind burr grinder, and I fricking hate it. It creates loads of fines, it makes a big static-y mess, and worst of all it's painfully loud. So, it's time for an upgrade.

I'm in New Zealand, and my budget is roughly $200 NZD... roughly. Looking at the [the wiki's recommended grinders, the ones I'm considering are](https://reddit.com/r/Coffee/wiki/gear_by_price)

* The [Bodum Bistro](https://www.amazon.com.au/Bodum-Bistro-Electric-Coffee-Grinder/dp/B0043095WW/) for $153.69 NZD
* The [Baratza Encore](https://www.laffare.co.nz/shop/machines/grinders/baratza-encore/) for $260 NZD
* The [Breville Dose Control Pro](https://www.amazon.com.au/Breville-Bcg600Sil-Control-Grinder-Stainless/dp/B00MNJM1RG/) for $260.95. It's effectively a less-fancy option of the [Breville Smart Grinder Pro](https://www.amazon.com.au/Breville-Bcg820Bss-Grinder-Brushed-Stainless/dp/B071F7C193/), which is designed for espresso, but the wiki says it's good for filter coffee.

Also, my preference is for electric grinders, but I'm open to a hand grinder if it can grind 20 grams of light-roast coffee beans to a filter coffee size (V60) in under a minute, and is decently durable.

This is my current setup more precisely:

**Grinder:** Wilfa CGWS-130b. **Espresso machine:** Delonghi Dedica EC685.

**Modifications:** Rancilio Silvia V1 steam wand (one hole) + Bottomless portafilter (nonpressurized)

(I also have a water filter jug, a distributor and a steel tamper.)

I am looking into the Rancilio Silvia E V6 (machine) + Rocky (grinder) combination, because I want to make richer espressos and smoother milk, of course. 

I am mostly curious about the espresso with this upgrade. I *know* the milk steaming will be so much better with three holes at the Silvia steam tip, so there's no question about the value there.   
(I have a good amount of experience (6 months) with a La Marzocco Linea PB (Rather spoiled at work), which has four holes at the steam tip). 

However, let's pretend that the only upgrade I got was getting an *actual* espresso grinder e.g. getting a Rancilio Rocky (the Wilfa model at best only does moka pot fineness, and besides it's not even a stepless grinder). **Would such an upgrade ""suffice"" as far as getting richer espresso is concerned?** I suppose what I am really asking is ""how big"" an upgrade would *that* be value-wise compared to *also* getting a ""better"" espresso machine? 

This leads me to another question: **Assuming I know exactly what I am doing; and that I am using an espresso grinder; and that I am using all equipment to its fullest potential, then** ***what would I be able to accomplish*** **with a Silvia** ***which I could never accomplish*** **with a modded Dedica?

First time I’m ever writing a Reddit post though I’m a long time lurker :)

I have a de longhi Eletta cappuccino top; it’s about one and a half years old. It has, most recently developed a weird habit - it grinds for way too long. Even when I adjust it to short coffee and extra-mild taste, it grinds for ages - roughly as long as you’d expect for an extra-long extra-strong coffee. If already tried fiddling with the coarseness but that didn’t yield any results.

For now, I can circumvent the issue by just filling in a spoonful of coffee every time I want a coup - which means the coffee machine, when making my cup, grinds the small quantity of coffee I actually need, and afterwards a lot of thin air.

I just purchased an open box Profitec Pro 300 and I have been having issues with the device tripping my GFCI. Here's a scenario I experienced:

Turned machine on
Waited ~10 minutes
PID read 93C (which was the configured temperature)
Turned on the brew switch, 
Brewed for 23 seconds
Hit the brew switch to off
GFCI tripped

I then tried again three separate times and it functioned properly, waiting each time for the PID to read 93.

The fifth time, I did not wait until the PID read 93, but instead was in the high 60s, hit the switch on, after a few seconds, hit the switch off and the GFCI tripped.

I have had occasions where I'd purge the machine after cleaning the portafilter and it would trip the GFCI.

It does not trip the breaker when plugged into another circuit (but it trips other GFCIs on the same line). It only happens when switching off the brew switch.

My first attempt seemed okay and it is a different taste in the coffee, but I want to learn how the different minerals affect taste.

My first attempt targeted       40 ppm kh alkalinity with baking soda, 70 total permanent hardness equally magnesium and caclium via epsom salt heptahydrate and calcium chloride anyhdrous (note, the minerals were not equal in measurement but equal in the end result of hardness they would add which took almost twice as much magnesium heptahydrate since it has more water molecules in it than anhydrous calcium chloride.) 

From what I can gather based on the measurements of ingredients in TWW its profile is: 40 to 50 ppm alkalinity kh and 135 to 160 total hardness about 88% magnesium 12% calcium.  So diluted 50% would be 20 to 25 alkalinity and 70 to 80 hardness.  

I tried two coffees and compared to same brew parameters they were more airy and clean than the same with 50% diluted TWW.  Their sweetness was more background and lighter.  The TWW brewed coffee had more direct sweetness.  I liked aspects of both.   


From what I have read magnesium brings out sweetness where calcium brings out creamy texture.  I could see how the smooth, airness I got in the 50/50 magnesium calcium might have come from calcium.  Perhaps the lack of direct sweetness was from the higher alkalinity?  I noticed when I use TWW 100% it is often creamier, maybe from 40 to 50 alkalinity toning down acidity, but still more sweet from the higher magnesium.

I ended up getting a Toddy (which I love - so simple to use) and a subscription to the percolator pre-ground Taste coffee subscription. I guess my palette grew because the next time I went to Starbucks, the cold brew tasted… flat.

So - I want to start developing more of an appreciation for coffee but… again, I am kind of limited to cold brew. I noticed most roasters don’t sell preground - which I understand.

I am not sure if this comes across, but the color ranges wildly. Individually, some beans look great for a light, medium, or even dark roast. Others are very dark, but still have their silver skin intact somehow. Some are just straight up burnt. Others have splotches of burned portions.

The smell: opening the bag, it smells like an ashtray. I'll be generous and say I also detect notes of anise and apple.
